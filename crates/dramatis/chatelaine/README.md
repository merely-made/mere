# chatelaine

Name reservation for **chatelaine**, the secret half of the Mere platform's
credential model.

Named for the waist-worn chain that held the household's keys, and by
extension the keeper of them. The chatelaine holds what must never be shown:
passwords, 2FA seeds, tokens, foreign key material. Everything here is damaged
by disclosure, so chatelaine items are exercised (filled, generated, released
through the gate), never presented.

The boundaries are the point: not the proofs (that is
[insigne](https://crates.io/crates/insigne): public-key artifacts made to be
shown; the boundary is cryptographic, not filing), not the keeper (that is
[castellan](https://crates.io/crates/castellan)), and not the storage
substrate (that is [personae](https://crates.io/crates/personae)'s vault; the
chatelaine is the item taxonomy kept there).

Lives in the [mere](https://github.com/merely-made/mere) workspace under
`crates/dramatis/`. Built: the item taxonomy (items, credentials of every CXF
v1.0 kind, collections, links, the import disposition per kind, and the OTP
display enums), plain serde data depending only on serde and uuid.

Ruled 2026-10-01: chatelaine becomes a plain taxonomy, like insigne's core.
It holds CXF-shaped item kinds and secret-free metadata (ids, labels, persona
scope, origin), with no secret bytes, no storage and no cryptography.
Castellan keeps the sealed store and exercises the items. The CXF import
policy for all 17 credential types, including which ones are quarantined for
the user's review, is in the dramatis tier architecture in mere's
`design_docs`.
