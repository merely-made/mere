//! The persona picker: one list, one convention, every Merely application.
//!
//! Turnstone, Woodshed, Knot, Hocket and the rest all ask the same question at
//! startup — which persona am I? — and they all answer it against the same
//! shared vault, whose roster djinn reads for them ([`dramatis::roster`];
//! dramatis repo plan, D5). What varies is only where the list is
//! shown. So the list itself lives here: how a persona reads in a row, which
//! one is marked as in use, what a vault with nothing in it says.
//!
//! Built on Cambium's [`command_picker`], which supplies the interaction
//! (keyboard navigation, selection, dismissal) already. This crate is the
//! view-model: roster in, rows out, chosen persona back.
//!
//! The shape an application takes, illustrative rather than compile-ready:
//!
//! ```text
//! let mut djinn = CustodyClient::open(app).await?;   // graphshell's client
//! let list = djinn.roster().await?;
//! let view = persona_picker_focused(&state, &list);  // or persona_picker
//! // on PickerEvent::Chose(id): djinn.choose_profile(id).await?, then reread.
//! ```
