//! The fleet's SSH certificate authority, projected from delegation.
//!
//! [`crate::ssh_slot`] serves keys; this serves *authority*. A key in an
//! `authorized_keys` file is a bilateral fact — one key, one account, one
//! machine, enrolled by hand. An OpenSSH certificate is a statement the
//! holder carries: any host that trusts the CA accepts it, so N machines
//! cost N enrollments rather than N².
//!
//! Nothing here is a second delegation model. A certificate is *minted
//! from* a [`SignedDelegationCertificate`] and carries its
//! [`DelegationId`] as the OpenSSH key id, so an SSH login traces back to
//! the grant that authorized it and a revocation of that grant names the
//! certificate without a second ledger. Per the 2026-08-11 reconciliation
//! ruling, the grammar in [`crate::delegation`] stays the only one.
//!
//! The CA key is derived from the master through the ordinary
//! protocol-salt ceremony and attested by it, so the master itself signs
//! no certificate and appears in no `sshd_config`.
//!
//! Feature `ssh`.
