//! The capability-scope convention for device grants.
//!
//! A device grant is a delegation like any other: a persona delegating a
//! scoped, expiring capability to a device it controls. This module fixes how
//! such a grant addresses itself in [`CapabilityScope`] so that every issuer
//! and every verifier builds the same scope for the same device.

/// so the scope satisfies `CapabilityScope`'s well-formedness rule.
///
/// It is a leaf rather than a root. `insigne::delegation::path_covers` only
/// extends a prefix when the remainder begins with `/`, so this value covers
/// itself and nothing beneath it. Giving device capabilities a real path
