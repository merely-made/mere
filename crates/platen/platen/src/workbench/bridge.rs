//! The TileLayout ⇄ forme bridge: derive a geometry-free [`Arrangement`] plus a
//! Tree-projection [`TreeGeometry`] from the live split tree, and rebuild the
//! split tree from that pair — losslessly.
//!
//! Per the composition spine (§9): the `(Arrangement, TreeGeometry)` pair is the
//! *persisted / canonical* form (forme owns the semantic arrangement, the
//! geometry store owns the per-projection layout), and the [`TileLayout`]'s `Pane`
//! split tree is the *live working model* — the derived cache the host mutates
//! (the verified tiling logic in [`super::tree`]). [`TileLayout::to_arrangement`]
//! derives the canonical pair after an edit (to persist); [`TileLayout::from_arrangement`]
//! rebuilds the working tree on load. With the geometry present the rebuild is
//! exact; without it the TileLayout falls back to the arrangement's default flat
//! projection ([`project_tree`]) — the "responsive from one saved geometry" story.
//!
//! Boundary: forme's arrangement stays honestly semantic — membership
//! (`MemberIntent`) + tab grouping (`StackedWith`); the *tree shape* (axis,
//! nesting, order), fractions, and active tab live in the geometry sidecar,
//! because "the tree shape is a projection, not arrangement truth" (spine §2).
