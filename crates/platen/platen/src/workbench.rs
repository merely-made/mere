//! The tiled layout model (S4): platen's canonical tiling state.
//!
//! The orrery and the tiled workbench are two **projections of one arrangement**
//! (the composition spine): the orrery is the [`ProjectionKind::Cartography`]
//! projection (graph members positioned spatially), the tiled layout the
//! [`ProjectionKind::Tree`] one. This module owns the tiling state (the split tree of
//! tab-stacks, the active tab per stack, the projection mode) and turns it into placed,
//! content-resolved tiles a host renders.
//!
//! The layout is a **recursive split tree** (see [`tree`]): a leaf is a tab-stack
//! (one or more members, one visible), and a split lays its children along an axis (a
//! `Row` side-by-side, a `Column` top-to-bottom), each with a fractional share. Splits
//! nest, so the tree expresses every variation: horizontal, vertical, and combinations.
//! It is geometry-free; layout is the host's genet/taffy job, reached through
//! [`TileLayout::to_tile_tree`] (the Genet tile surface) and [`TileLayout::slot_views`] (the
//! a11y / automation projection).
//!
//! Replaces the legacy `FrameState` / `PaneBinding` frame model (the pre-spine
//! pane-binding workbench), per the 2026-06-04 platen taffy-retarget plan.
