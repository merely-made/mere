//! Projection geometry — the geometry sidecar for a forme's **Tree** projection.
//! (Cartography geometry moved to the canvas crate in the 2026-07-09 platen
//! decomposition; this file keeps the pane-lane Tree geometry.)
//!
//! Per the composition spine (§9, §15): `forme` owns the geometry-free *semantic*
//! arrangement (which members are present, which are tabbed together); this owns
//! the *semantic geometry* of one projection of it, keyed `(FormeRef,
//! ProjectionKind)` in the projection-geometry store. For the Tree projection
//! that geometry is the split **skeleton** (axis, nesting, sibling order), each
//! split's **fractions**, and each leaf stack's **active** tab.
//!
//! "Semantic geometry, not pixels": fractions are *ratios*, never rectangles, so
//! one saved geometry renders responsively at any pane size, and is shared across
//! panes projecting the same forme the same way (two independent layouts are
//! *forked formes*, not one bench in two views). Leaves are **member-keyed** so a
//! saved geometry survives re-projection and reconciles against the arrangement.
//!
//! A [`TreeGeometry`] is a structural mirror of the tiled layout's live split tree
//! (platen's [`TileLayout`](crate::TileLayout)): the bridge
//! ([`TileLayout::to_arrangement`](crate::TileLayout::to_arrangement) /
//! [`TileLayout::from_arrangement`](crate::TileLayout::from_arrangement)) derives an
//! `(Arrangement, TreeGeometry)` pair
//! from a tree and rebuilds the tree from the pair, losslessly. The arrangement
//! is the semantic + re-projection truth; this is the layout refinement over the
//! arrangement's default flat projection ([`crate::project_tree`]).
