//! The resident spatial lane: positions that never come home.
//!
//! Promoted from the spatial compute plan's P2 and P3 probes
//! (`2026-08-13_spatial_compute_plan.md`). Positions and velocities
//! live in GPU buffers as padded 3D `vec4f`; three dispatches per frame
//! advance them; the only per-frame readback is a four-byte settle
//! word. A consumer that wants to draw them binds
//! [`crate::resident::Resident::positions`] directly, or, if its renderer addresses
//! memory some other way, publishes from it with a kernel of its own.
//!
//! # Which lane this is
//!
//! The spatial stack has two GPU lanes, and they are not rivals:
//!
//! - the **tensor lane** ([`seiche::repulsion`], Burn), for
//!   dense field evaluation, semantic couplings, and anything that
//!   benefits from fusion;
//! - the **explicit lane**, here, for the resident n-body step, where
//!   exact memory control is the whole point. The tensor formulation
//!   materializes `[n, n]` intermediates and cannot reach the sizes a
//!   canvas needs; this one holds `O(n)`.
//!
//! # Device
//!
//! The device is the host's, never this crate's. A second device on the
//! same adapter cannot share a buffer with the renderer, which is the
//! failure the wing's tenancy seam exists to prevent, so
//! [`crate::resident::Resident::new`] takes handles rather than booting.
