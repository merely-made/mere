//! A shared spatial runtime.
//!
//! Conatus owns the product-facing vocabulary for bodies, collision, spatial
//! queries, fixed stepping, and spatial changes. Product runtime profiles
//! decide when to advance it and which other organs participate. The current
//! tactile backend is Rapier 3D, kept private so products do not acquire
//! Rapier handles or math types. A later Nexus or resident-GPU backend can
//! replace that machinery behind the same body vocabulary.
//!
//! This crate owns the spatial state it advances. Renderers consume
//! [`BodyState`] changes; they do not own transforms. Product records decide
//! which spatial outcomes become durable facts.
