# seiche

Kernel-free, rapier-backed force integration for graph canvases. A host feeds
`(NodeKey, position)` pairs and edge pairs; `Simulation` owns the rapier world
that settles them and the host reads the positions back. Fields come from
[`numen`](../numen); the graph itself stays host-side.

`NodeKey` is `petgraph::stable_graph::NodeIndex`, so a consumer supplies keys
from any graph or mints them directly. seiche never inspects them.

## Core types

| Item | Contents |
|---|---|
| `Simulation` | The rapier world, the `NodeKey` to `RigidBodyHandle` map, the registered forces, and the scene / fluid / emitter tiers. `Send`, so it can run on its own thread. |
| `Force` | `fn apply(&self, ctx: &mut ForceContext<'_>, dt: f32)`. Registered forces are applied in registration order each tick, before the step. |
| `ForceContext<'a>` | Per-tick view a force sees: `bodies`, `colliders`, `joints`, `bodies_by_node`, `edges`, `repulsion_solver`, `gpu_repulsion_threshold`. |
| `RepulsionSolver` | `Arc<dyn Fn(&[f32], &[f32], RepulsionRequest) -> Result<RepulsionForces, RepulsionSolverError>>`. A validated host staging closure; `NodeExclusion` routes to it above a host-selected threshold and falls back if it fails. |
| `NODE_BODY_RADIUS` / `NODE_BODY_DENSITY` | `18.0` and `0.001`, chosen so a node's mass is about 1.0. |
| `DEFAULT_GPU_REPULSION_THRESHOLD` | `1_000` nodes, a host-configurable staging guard rather than a residency crossover. |

## Modules

Every item below is re-exported at the crate root. `scene_spec`, `node_body`,
and `view` are private modules, so those types are reachable only as
`seiche::SceneSpec`, `seiche::NodeCollider`, `seiche::LayoutView`, and so on.

| Source | Public items | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `forces` | `NodeExclusion`, `EdgeSpring`, `Boundary` | The built-in layout forces. |
| `barnes_hut` | `BarnesHutRepulsion`, `BarnesHutConfig`, `repulsion_forces` | Quadtree O(n log n) approximate n-body repulsion. `BarnesHutRepulsion` implements `Force`. |
| `coupling_force` | `CouplingForce` | Compiles an already-resolved field plus target set into a `Force`; numen evaluates, seiche applies. Built via `CouplingForce::new` and `with_registry`. |
| `affinity_force` | `AffinitySpring`, `DEFAULT_AFFINITY_STIFFNESS`, `DEFAULT_AFFINITY_REST_LENGTH` | Weighted attract-only spring over `(a, b, weight)` triples. |
| `anchor_force` | `AnchorSpring`, `DEFAULT_ANCHOR_STIFFNESS`, `DEFAULT_ANCHOR_SLACK` | Per-node springs toward arrangement-chosen slots. |
| `fluid` | `Fluid`, `FluidParams`, `Basin`, `FluidContact`, `ContactShape` | Position-Based Fluids solver, stepped after the rigid world and coupled two ways. |
| `scene_spec` | `SceneSpec`, `SceneBodySpec`, `SceneBodyId`, `SceneBodyType`, `SceneJoint`, `SceneJointSpec`, `JointMotorSpec`, `SceneEmitter`, `SceneField` | The declarative scene format. |
| `scenes` | `drop_bowl_scene`, `pyramid_scene`, `domino_scene`, `galton_scene`, `funnel_scene`, `drift_scene`, `chain_scene`, `ball_and_chain_scene`, `bridge_scene`, `cradle_scene`, `mixer_scene`, `whirlpool_scene`, `fountain_scene` | Ready-made `SceneSpec`s. Data, not engine code. |
| `node_body` | `NodeCollider`, `NodeMaterial` | A node body's collider shape and physical material. |
| `view` | `LayoutView`, `LayoutSnapshot`, `RectSelection`, `SceneBodyView` | The rapier-free read model. `LayoutSnapshot` is the `Send` payload a physics actor emits each tick; `LayoutView` applies it and answers picks, cull, edge segments, and marquee select on the UI thread. |

## Driving a simulation

- **Topology.** `sync_nodes` reconciles the body set to a `(NodeKey, position)`
  list, `sync_edges` sets the spring topology, `seed_positions` places bodies
  without reconciling. All idempotent.
- **Forces.** `add_force` for the built-ins, `set_coupling_forces` /
  `set_affinity_force` / `set_anchor_force` to replace those tiers wholesale,
  `set_repulsion_solver` to install a host solver. Force swaps leave body state
  untouched, so the layout stays where it is.
- **Stepping.** `tick(dt)` applies every force, steps the world, then steps the
  fluid and its coupling. `is_at_rest` and `wants_continuous_tick` answer
  whether the tick can be suspended.
- **Reading.** `positions`, `position_of`, `view`, `snapshot(generation)`, plus
  the in-thread `hit_test`, `cull_aabb`, `edge_segments`, `edge_hit_test`, and
  `rect_select`.
- **Dragging.** `pin` switches a body to kinematic-position control, `unpin`
  returns it to dynamic.
- **Scene, fluid, emitters.** `load_scene` / `add_scene_body` / `clear_scene` /
  `set_gravity` / `set_nodes_tangible`, `load_fluid` / `clear_fluid`,
  `set_scene_field`, `add_emitter` / `clear_emitters`. Scene loading and live
  emitters are both capped at 200 bodies.

Writing settled positions back into the host's own graph is the host's job.

## Driving the physics runtime

`Physics::advance_frame` keeps its deterministic one-tick behavior for inline
callers. The additive `advance_elapsed(view, elapsed, config)` instead accepts
host-measured `Duration`, runs bounded fixed steps, and publishes one snapshot.
It does not read a clock or schedule frames. Pictograph's opt-in `frame_at` /
`frame_profiled_at` methods and the Graphshell Cambium tree use it. Existing
deterministic Canvas callers and the older presenter retain their prior path.

`ElapsedStepConfig` makes the per-call elapsed cap and step cap configurable;
defaults are 50 ms and three steps. `ElapsedStepReport` records executed steps,
discarded time, carried time and whether physics still needs advancement.
Only a fraction below one step carries forward: excess whole-step debt is
dropped, including when the step cap is zero. A zero elapsed cap accepts no
new time. Halted or idle time is discarded in full. These bounds limit catch-up
work, not the CPU cost of an individual step.

`TICK_DURATION` is the nominal 60 Hz interval rounded to 16,666,667 ns; 60
intervals are one second plus 20 ns. Integration still uses the existing
`TICK_DT` value. Consequently a 50 ms contribution alone contains two complete
rounded intervals and a fraction, rather than exactly three.

`seed`, `halt`, and switching to `advance_frame` clear fractional debt.
`reset_elapsed` clears it without changing motion or positions. On suspension,
the host must also reset its timestamp so hidden time never enters the first
resumed call. Offloaded actors retain their own pacing: `advance_elapsed` only
drains accepted snapshots and reports zero host-executed steps and durations.

## Features

`gpu-bench` enables seiche's `tensor-burn-wgpu` path so an ignored benchmark can
stage the exact `NodeExclusion` law through a WGPU CPU-GPU-CPU round trip. It is
not the resident simulation path. Off by default; the shipped library does not
compile Burn.

## Dependencies

rapier2d 0.33, petgraph 0.8, numen, euclid, tracing, with Burn and Burn-WGPU as
optional tensor-law backends.
