//! The runtime: where a [`Simulation`] actually ticks.
//!
//! A [`Simulation`] integrates when someone calls [`Simulation::tick`]; *who*
//! calls it, and on which thread, is a separate decision every host faces.
//! This module is that decision, made once: two shapes behind one [`Physics`]
//! interface, so a host drives physics without owning a frame loop, a thread,
//! or a settle budget of its own. (Lifted out of `mere-canvas` 2026-09-04, so
//! the canvas, the remote board, and any other consumer share one backend.)
//!
//! - [`Physics::Inline`] — the simulation ticks **in the frame loop**, on the
//!   caller's thread. Deterministic (no thread race), so it is what tests
//!   drive; it is also the path for the no-threads `wasm32` browser/PWA
//!   profile, where an OS thread cannot be spawned.
//! - `Physics::Actor` — the simulation runs on an [`armillary`] **actor
//!   thread** (always-offload), behind the default `actor` feature. A heavy
//!   settle (`pipeline.step` over hundreds of bodies) never blocks compositing
//!   or input; the actor emits a [`LayoutSnapshot`] per step and the host folds
//!   it into its [`LayoutView`].
//!
//! Native builds construct [`Physics::Inline`] and immediately
//! `offload` onto an actor (so native always offloads); the host supplies the
//! wake that pokes its event loop when a snapshot lands. Either way the host
//! reads only its [`LayoutView`] — the backend just feeds authoritative
//! positions into it.
