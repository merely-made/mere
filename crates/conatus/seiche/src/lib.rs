//! # seiche
//!
//! Rapier-backed force integration for Mere: the crate that realizes the graph's
//! bodies as motion. A *seiche* is the standing-wave oscillation of a lake or bay,
//! the whole body of water rocking rhythmically back and forth; it moves the *mere*
//! (a mere is a lake) the way this crate moves the graph's bodies. Sibling to the
//! `numen` field-algebra crate: numen defines and evaluates fields and couplings;
//! `seiche` applies and integrates the force laws (rapier bodies, collision,
//! stepping) into positions.
//!
//! ## Place in the architecture
//!
//! The host's graph is the source of truth for node identity, topology,
//! and the *committed* position used for persistence. seiche holds the rapier
//! world that drives the *projected* position — bodies bound to nodes, forces
//! from pluggable [`Force`] implementors, and a tick that mirrors body
//! translations back to the graph each step.
//!
//! Petgraph (inside kernel) owns topology; seiche owns physical state. Both sit at
//! the substrate tier, consumed by everything above.
//!
//! ## Forces
//!
//! - [`Simulation`] — owns the rapier world, a [`NodeKey`] ↔
//!   [`RigidBodyHandle`] bimap, position-based hit-test / cull, and the
//!   registered forces.
//! - [`Simulation::sync_nodes`] / [`Simulation::sync_edges`] — keep bodies
//!   and edge topology in step with the host's node/edge lists. Idempotent.
//! - [`Simulation::tick`] — apply each registered [`Force`], then step the world.
//! - Built-in forces ([`NodeExclusion`], [`EdgeSpring`], [`Boundary`]) are the
//!   fast Rust default-path; numen's couplings are the general, scriptable
//!   path that compiles to the same [`Force`] contract.
//!
//! Until a [`Force`] is registered, the world ticks empty — bodies settle to
//! rest under damping alone.
//!
//! ## Decomposition
//!
//! The `Simulation` impl is split across files by concern so no one stays over
//! the per-file size ceiling: the struct + `new` + force registration + read
//! model + the [`tick`](Simulation::tick) heartbeat live here; the node-body
//! shape/material axis in [`node_body`], body lifecycle in [`sync`], the rigid
//! scene tier in [`scene_sim`], the fluid seam in [`fluid_coupling`], the
//! force-field tier in [`field`], and emitters in [`emitter`]. (Rust lets an
//! `impl` span modules; private fields stay reachable from these child modules.)
