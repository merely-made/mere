//! Containment proposals: the read-only half of "physics proposes, the
//! record disposes" (spatial compute plan P1, 2026-08-13).
//!
//! seiche answers the geometric question and nothing else: which scene
//! bodies contain a node right now. Which containments *mean* anything,
//! and when one becomes a recorded fact, is the host's decision at an
//! explicit commitment (a release gesture, a standing rule). No fact
//! type lives here, no log, no callback: a physics engine that owned
//! the record would be the projection ruling's refusal 2 built into the
//! substrate.
