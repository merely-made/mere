//! The physics catalog's laws.
//!
//! A law is a dynamical system over the node bodies — what force each feels,
//! from whom, as a function of what — and different laws produce different
//! layouts because they are different physics, not because one law was
//! tuned. Each law here is one [`Force`](crate::Force); a host installs a law
//! (and any overlays) with [`Simulation::set_forces`](crate::Simulation::set_forces)
//! and switches laws on a live simulation without reseeding.
//!
//! The laws, by what they reveal:
//!
//! - [`StressSpring`] — every pair a spring whose rest length is its graph
//!   distance: paths unroll to their true length, far things are far
//!   (Kamada–Kawai).
//! - [`LinLogForce`] — ForceAtlas2's force model: attraction linear in
//!   distance along edges, repulsion `1/d` between all, degree-weighted:
//!   communities as islands, hubs central. LinLog proper is its attraction
//!   exponent `0`.
//! - [`Gravity`] — n-body attraction with mass by degree and an orbital kick:
//!   the graph as a solar system, never at rest.
//! - [`ParticleLife`] — each node has a kind; kinds attract or repel by an
//!   asymmetric matrix: sorting, chasing and fleeing, never at rest.
//! - [`Boids`] — separation, alignment, cohesion with edge-neighbours as
//!   flockmates: constellations that move as groups.
//! - [`Kuramoto`] — phase oscillators coupled along edges, drawn on a ring:
//!   communities as phase clusters.
//! - [`MagneticSpring`] — directed edges align to a field: hierarchy and
//!   direction by physics.
//! - [`Anneal`] — stochastic descent on an energy under a cooling schedule.
//! - [`Density`] — nodes flow along the gradient of a diffused mass density
//!   until it is even: room follows mass (Gastner–Newman).
//!
//! Every law reads positions and topology from the [`ForceContext`](crate::ForceContext);
//! what a law needs beyond that (degree, kind, graph distance, mass) it takes
//! at construction from the host, the way `CouplingForce` snapshots its
//! targets, and the host rebuilds it when topology changes.
