//! The declarative scene **format**: the data types a [`SceneSpec`] is built from. A scene
//! is a list of [`SceneBodySpec`] (each a [`NodeCollider`] shape, a world spawn, an initial
//! velocity, Fixed-or-Dynamic, a restitution, a per-body gravity scale and rotation), the
//! world settings (gravity, default tangibility, whether it is perpetual), and a list of
//! [`SceneJointSpec`] binding pairs of bodies (hinges, ropes, springs, welds).
//!
//! Pure data, no engine: [`Simulation::load_scene`](crate::Simulation::load_scene) consumes a
//! `SceneSpec`, and [`crate::scenes`] builds ready-made ones. Split out of `lib.rs` because the
//! format grows independently of the simulation core (and `lib.rs` is already at the ceiling).
