//! Built-in force forces for the orrery's force-directed layout.
//!
//! Three forces compose into a Fruchterman-Reingold-shaped layout:
//!
//! - [`NodeExclusion`] — every node repels every other, spreading them apart
//!   (the "charge"). This is the long-range push *beyond* the hard ball-collider
//!   contact that already prevents overlap.
//! - [`EdgeSpring`] — connected nodes attract along their edge (Hooke's law
//!   toward a rest length), pulling neighbors together.
//! - [`Boundary`] — a weak centering pull toward the origin so disconnected
//!   pieces stay on screen and the whole layout stays bounded.
//!
//! Each force reads body positions and accumulates forces through
//! `add_force`; [`crate::Simulation::tick`] walks the registered forces before
//! stepping, and rapier's per-body damping settles the result to rest.
//!
//! All three constants are public so the host can tune feel (per the
//! configurability-over-defaults stance); the defaults give a readable layout
//! at Mere's world scale (1 unit ~= 1 px, node radius
//! [`crate::NODE_BODY_RADIUS`]).
