# mere-transport

The peer transport layer for the [mere](https://crates.io/crates/mere) browser.
Package name is `mere-transport`; the lib is `transport`, so consumers write
`use transport::...`.

It wraps [iroh](https://www.iroh.computer) for authenticated, encrypted QUIC
streams between known peers, exposes content-addressed blob storage (BLAKE3 via
`iroh-blobs`), and presents a `Transport` trait the rest of the workspace takes
as a generic parameter rather than a `Box<dyn Transport>`.

Consumers layer their own framing on the byte stream. Each protocol registers
its own ALPN string (`mere/cable/v1`, `mere/coop/v1`, and so on) so several
protocols share one peer connection.

## Public surface

`blobs`, `memory`, `p2panda_transport`, and the three feature modules are
public. `transport`, `accepted`, `peer_id`, `alpn`, and `error` are private and
their contents are re-exported at the crate root, so a caller writes
`transport::PeerID`.

| Source | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `transport` | The `Transport` trait |
| `accepted` | `AcceptedSession<S>`, `IngressContext`, `IngressInterfaceId`, `TransportKind` |
| `p2panda_transport` | `P2pandaTransport`, `P2pandaTransportBuilder`, `P2pandaStream`, `KnownPeer`, `sync_overlay_topic`, re-exports `MdnsDiscoveryMode` and `RelayUrl` |
| `memory` | `MemoryTransport::pair(a, b)`, the in-process test fixture |
| `peer_id` | `PeerID` (newtype over `Ed25519PublicKey`; `from_public_key`, `public_key`, `to_bytes`, `from_bytes`) |
| `alpn` | `Alpn`, a hash-friendly protocol-name newtype |
| `blobs` | `BlobStore`, `BlobHash`, `BlobError` |
| `error` | `TransportError` |
| `noise` (feature) | `NoiseStream`, `NoiseListener`, `handshake`, `secure_initiator`, `secure_responder`, `connect_to`, `accept_from`, `ProofError`, `NOISE_PARAMS` |
| `notochord` (feature) | `AcceptedSession::session_facts` / `into_session`, `initiator_binding`, `initiator_link_binding` |
| `reticulum_transport` (feature) | `ReticulumTransport`, `ReticulumTransportBuilder`, `ReticulumInterface`, `ReticulumStream` |

Root also re-exports `p2panda_net::gossip::GossipHandle`, plus
`Ed25519PublicKey` and `IdentityProvider` from identity, and the `VERSION` /
`STAGE` consts.

## The `Transport` trait

```rust,ignore
pub trait Transport: Send + Sync {
    type Stream: AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + Send + Unpin + 'static;
    fn local_peer_id(&self) -> PeerID;
    fn connect(&self, peer: PeerID, alpn: Alpn)
        -> impl Future<Output = Result<Self::Stream, TransportError>> + Send;
    fn accept(&self, alpn: Alpn)
        -> impl Future<Output = Result<AcceptedSession<Self::Stream>, TransportError>> + Send;
}
```

`accept` returns an `AcceptedSession`, not a bare stream: the stream plus the
protocol, the ingress context, and `peer: Option<PeerID>`. `peer` is `Some`
only where the carrier itself authenticated it (p2panda, and `MemoryTransport`
by construction); Reticulum reports `None`. A subject named by application
bytes is never placed there. `is_transport_authenticated()` reads that
distinction; `into_stream()` discards the context.

## Key entry points

| Item | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `P2pandaTransport::builder(&Ed25519Keypair)` | Builder over an identity keypair. `builder_from_seed([u8; 32])` takes a raw signing seed from an external provider. |
| `P2pandaTransportBuilder` | `alpns`, `blobs`, `relay_url`, `mdns`, `discovery`, `discovery_config`, `gossip`, then `bind()`. |
| `P2pandaTransport::bind` / `bind_seed` / `bind_with_blobs` | Shorthands for the common builds. `bind_with_blobs` makes the router serve iroh-blobs. |
| `endpoint_addr`, `ticket`, `add_peer`, `add_peer_ticket`, `peer_ticket` | Explicit bootstrap: serialize this node's `EndpointAddr` to a pasteable ticket and dial back from one. |
| `subscribe(topic: [u8; 32]) -> GossipHandle` | Joins a gossip topic; `publish(bytes)` broadcasts, `subscribe()` yields received bytes. |
| `set_topics`, `remove_topic`, `peers_for_topic` | Topic bookkeeping for peers reached without discovery. |
| `sync_parts() -> Option<(Endpoint, Gossip)>` | The parts a LogSync session is built from above this crate. |
| `sync_overlay_topic(sync_topic) -> [u8; 32]` | Derives the overlay topic LogSync joins gossip on. Explicit bootstrap must tag peers with it. |
| `BlobStore::new()` / `BlobStore::open(root)` | In-memory (`iroh_blobs` `MemStore`) or on-disk (`FsStore`) behind the same API; `is_persistent()` reports which. |
| `put_bytes`, `get_bytes`, `read_range`, `has`, `flush`, `shutdown` | Local blob operations. `fetch_from` downloads a blob from a peer over a `P2pandaTransport`. |

`PeerID` is named for peer identity to keep it distinct from `kernel`'s graph
`NodeId`.

## Features

| Feature | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `reticulum` (off) | Builds `ReticulumTransport` over `retinue`, Mark's Rust Reticulum stack, for the bilateral stream lane on LoRa / packet-radio / serial links. Sync and blob transfer stay iroh-only. Adds `retinue`, `hkdf`, `sha2`. |
| `noise` (off) | An application-layer Noise_XX handshake that composes inside a stream a carrier already opened, and stands alone over TCP where there is no carrier. Adds `snow`, `hkdf`, `sha2`. |
| `notochord` (off) | Converts an `AcceptedSession` into `notochord::SessionFacts`, plus the initiator-side proof bindings. |

The `notochord` integration test declares `required-features = ["notochord"]`,
so a bare `cargo test -p mere-transport` skips it.

## Dependencies

| Crate | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `identity` (`personae`) | `Ed25519Keypair` / `Ed25519PublicKey` behind `PeerID`. External providers can pass a raw 32-byte seed instead. |
| `iroh` 1.0.3 (floor) | QUIC. 1.0.2 exact-pinned a dalek prerelease; 1.0.3 relaxed it to a range. |
| `iroh-blobs`, `iroh-tickets` | Content-addressed storage; pasteable `EndpointAddr` tickets. |
| `p2panda-net` | The endpoint authority behind `P2pandaTransport`: discovery, relay and hole-punching, gossip, LogSync. Pins iroh 1.0. |
| `p2panda-core` | Operation types on the sync path. |
| `tokio` | Stream I/O, the accept plumbing, `endpoint_addr`'s discovery wait. |
| `retinue`, `snow`, `hkdf`, `sha2`, `notochord` | Optional, per the features above. |

## Consumers

- `murm` opens a stream per cabal, carries signed p2panda-core operations over
  it, and reconciles the log over gossip plus LogSync.
- `gemot` uses transport streams and gossip topics for moot-scoped event sync.
- `mesh` rides `P2pandaTransport` and `sync_overlay_topic` for its sync lane.
- `commons-spine` depends on it with `reticulum` enabled.
- eidetic's `iroh-fetcher` feature fetches artifacts through `BlobStore` / `BlobHash`
  over a `P2pandaTransport`.

## Status

Pre-1.0 (`STAGE = "pre-alpha"`). The `Transport` trait, `MemoryTransport`,
`P2pandaTransport` (with gossip and LogSync served off the same endpoint), and
both memory- and disk-backed `BlobStore` are in place. The `reticulum`,
`noise`, and `notochord` lanes are present behind their features, default-off.
Production discovery wiring continues to land.

Protocol semantics (the cabal log, folds, tiers) live above this crate.
