//! p2panda-net-backed [`Transport`] implementation — the production transport.
//!
//! [`P2pandaTransport`] makes `p2panda-net`'s `Endpoint` the endpoint authority:
//! it runs a real iroh QUIC endpoint (via p2panda-net), demultiplexes incoming
//! connections by ALPN through p2panda-net's `Endpoint::accept` (iroh
//! `ProtocolHandler`) into per-ALPN queues that [`Transport::accept`] drains, and
//! opens a fresh bidirectional stream per [`Transport::connect`]. It optionally
//! serves the `iroh-blobs` protocol off the same endpoint.
//!
//! Compared to the retired hand-rolled `IrohTransport` Router, this gains
//! p2panda-net's discovery (`Discovery` / `MdnsDiscovery`), relay/hole-punching,
//! NAT port-mapping, and actor supervision for free, and keeps the same
//! one-endpoint / many-protocols / raw-ALPN-stream behavior the `Transport`
//! trait promises.
//!
//! ## Identity
//!
//! Constructed from an [`identity::Ed25519Keypair`] or a provider-neutral raw
//! 32-byte Ed25519 signing seed. The latter lets sibling applications use an
//! external identity provider such as Personae without coupling this crate to
//! it. In either case the seed bridges the ed25519-dalek major-version boundary
//! without forcing either side to upgrade.
//!
//! ## Discovery
//!
//! Three mechanisms share the one endpoint, each opt-in via the builder:
//!
//! - **Explicit peer** (tests, LAN): a peer's [`endpoint_addr`] (its real
//!   interface addresses, with loopback covering wildcard binds) is shared
//!   out-of-band and inserted via [`add_peer`].
//! - **mDNS** (`builder().mdns(..)`): same-network peers auto-populate the
//!   address book.
//! - **Random-walk** (`builder().discovery()`): walkers explore outward from
//!   bootstrap nodes already in the address book to reach internet peers; the
//!   handle is held for the transport's life.
//!
//! [`Ed25519Keypair::to_seed`]: identity::Ed25519Keypair::to_seed
//! [`endpoint_addr`]: P2pandaTransport::endpoint_addr
//! [`add_peer`]: P2pandaTransport::add_peer
