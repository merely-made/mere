//! What a transport bind leaves of its signing seed (vault lock ruling 51):
//! personae's tracker, included by path, in one process.
//!
//! Each run binds and closes once, armed, as a spawned task (so its frames
//! are heap allocations the tracker sees, as in a resident), and lists the
//! blocks that held the seed when freed uncleared. Baselines come first:
//! iroh alone, and p2panda-net alone, built the way the transport builds
//! it, with every p2panda future and handle boxed where it is made. What the
//! transport adds beyond that baseline is its own: a block, freed or still
//! live, whose size is in every transport run and in no baseline run fails.
//! The transport also asks, between bind and close, each question that reads
//! iroh's endpoint. Each shape runs five times, so one-off scheduling blocks
//! (and the rare iroh task still holding its key when the run disarms) do
//! not count.
//!
//! The baseline also nests its bind and close as deep as the transport's.
//! p2panda-net leaves key bytes on the worker's stack while it binds, and a
//! later message to its endpoint actor (ractor boxes the whole 392-byte
//! enum, unused bytes included) can copy them to the heap; whether it does
//! depends on stack depth, so a shallower baseline would hide it.
//!
//! The default host policy turns mDNS on, so a third shape binds through it,
//! against p2panda-net with gossip and mDNS spawned in the transport's order
//! (ruling 60).
//!
//! No libtest harness: the allocator is process-wide.
