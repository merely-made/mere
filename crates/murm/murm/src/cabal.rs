//! Cabal-level types for bilateral comms.
//!
//! A *cabal* in Murm terminology is a long-lived bilateral or small-group
//! conversation in Mere's Cable-shaped dialect. These words name the domain
//! grammar; they do not assert cabal-club wire compatibility. A cabal has:
//!
//! - A 32-byte symmetric **cabal key** ([`CabalKey`], shared secret,
//!   distributed out-of-band among members)
//! - A **cabal id** ([`CabalId`], public identifier, derived from the key
//!   via BLAKE3 — used for addressing and discovery without revealing the
//!   secret)
//! - One or more **named channels** (per Cable spec §2.5: `"session"`,
//!   `"links"`, etc.)
//! - A persistent or ephemeral post store (Phase 2B uses in-memory)
//!
//! Per Cable spec §2.2, the user's per-cabal Ed25519 keypair is derived
//! from `BLAKE3(master_secret || cabal_key)` — that derivation lives in
//! [`identity::IdentityProvider::derive_keypair`].
