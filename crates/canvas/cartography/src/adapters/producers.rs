//! Graph work whose result is a disclosure.
//!
//! Two arrangements read graph topology: rings come from a breadth-first walk,
//! and spectral coordinates come from the graph Laplacian. Neither computation
//! belongs in a solver — `sceno`'s contract is that solvers never learn a
//! source's native truth, and a score carries no relations to learn it from.
//!
//! Both reduce to a small per-item value, so the walk happens once here, beside
//! the graph that already exists, and what crosses into the score is a ring
//! index or a pair of coordinates. This is the same shape `Hulls` has always
//! used: the adapter discloses a coordinate, the solver tiles.
