//! # Cartography
//!
//! Non-destructive projection layer for the
//! [Mere](https://crates.io/crates/mere) browser.
//!
//! Cartography sits between **graph truth** + **intelligence signals**
//! on the input side, and **canvas swatches** on the output side. It
//! owns the *contracts* — the [`LayoutStrategy`] trait, the
//! [`Projection`] / [`Overlay`] / [`MinimapDescriptor`] vocabulary, and
//! the [`IntelligenceSignals`] narrow shape that firewalls cartography
//! from `embed`' internals. The strategies
//! themselves live in sibling crates (graph-layout, document-layout,
//! …).
//!
//! ## The strategy contract
//!
//! Cartography exposes the [`LayoutStrategy`] trait: one-shot, stateless
//! analytic projection. Picks: Phyllotaxis, Penrose, Radial, Grid,
//! Timeline, Kanban, L-system, Spectral, SemanticEmbedding. `project()`
//! produces a final projection in one call. Live force physics
//! (force-directed, the affinity force) is seiche's domain; the old
//! streaming-strategy contract was retired with the `SemanticEdgeWeight`
//! projection once the seiche affinity force reached parity.
//!
//! Strategies emit a [`Projection`]
//! output type so canvases consume one shape uniformly. See the
//! [cartography layer brief](https://github.com/merely-made/mere/blob/main/design_docs/mere_docs/research/2026-05-10_cartography_layer_brief.md)
//! for the full design.
//!
//! ## The framing
//!
//! Inputs:
//!
//! - [`kernel::graph::Graph`] — read-only reference.
//! - [`IntelligenceSignals`] — the facts a host's channel registry
//!   computed, keyed by channel id (an order, coordinates, rings, weights,
//!   clusters, pairs, bridge nodes), consumed through this narrow contract
//!   type, not a direct dependency on the producer's internals.
//! - [`ViewIntent`] — what the user is trying to see right now: scale,
//!   dimension, focus, filter, form factor (orrery root, workbench
//!   swatch, volvelle radial, astroid hub-collapse, minimap thumbnail).
//!
//! Outputs:
//!
//! - [`Projection`] — positioned nodes + edges + overlays at a chosen
//!   layout, ready for a canvas swatch to render.
//! - [`Overlay`] variants — semantic emphases canvases apply on top of
//!   geometry (cluster halos, edge weights, activity heat, bridge
//!   emphasis, importance scaling).
//! - [`MinimapDescriptor`] — thumbnail-scale projection of any swatch.
//!
//! The graph stays canonical. Cartography is *representation*, not
//! truth.
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! Pre-1.0. v0 ships contract types only — no strategy
//! implementations, no canvas integration.
