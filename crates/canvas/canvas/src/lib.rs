//! The canvas as a reusable, **window-agnostic content-root** — the graph's
//! spatial presentation (build item 1D of the genet-as-host flip; S1 of the
//! modular integration plan).
//!
//! [`Canvas`] owns the graph, its [`seiche::Simulation`], the camera, and the
//! pre-materialized abs-pos node-children pool. It exposes:
//!
//! - [`Canvas::frame`] — advance one frame at a given viewport and return the
//!   composited `netrender::Scene` plus whether another frame is needed (the sim
//!   still settling, pan still gliding, or a node being dragged). It does **not**
//!   present — the host (a winit bin, or meerkat's content-root) rasterizes +
//!   composites the returned scene.
//! - Semantic input methods ([`pointer_down`](Canvas::pointer_down) /
//!   [`pointer_up`](Canvas::pointer_up) / [`cursor_moved`](Canvas::cursor_moved) /
//!   [`wheel`](Canvas::wheel) / [`set_ctrl`](Canvas::set_ctrl) /
//!   [`reseed`](Canvas::reseed)), each returning whether a redraw is needed. The
//!   host maps its raw events (winit, genet input, …) onto these; the canvas
//!   never sees a window.
//!
//! The three composited layers (per the §6 plan): the [`crate::underlay`]
//! scene-paint underlay (edges + demoted off-screen node rects + coupling
//! overlays) under one camera transform; the on-screen nodes as abs-pos genet
//! DOM children (laid out incrementally, moved per-frame by inline transform on
//! the `RepaintOnly` path); and a screen-space marquee rubber-band when active.
//!
//! The sample graph, simulation, node-children pool, and the small paint/DOM
//! helpers live in [`mod@build`].
