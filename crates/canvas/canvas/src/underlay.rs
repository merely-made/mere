//! The canvas scene producer: graph → a painted `CanvasPaintList` underlay.
//!
//! This is the **host-agnostic scene-paint underlay** of the canvas under
//! genet-as-host (the [genet-as-host evaluation](../../../../design_docs/mere_docs/technical_architecture/2026-05-29_genet_as_host_evaluation.md)
//! §6, layer 1): edges + nodes + visual-coupling effects as one flat `PaintCmd`
//! list. The brief's load-bearing claim is that this list "renders identically
//! whether driven from a Masonry widget or a genet element", so the producer
//! lives here, host-neutral; the eventual genet canvas element (or any host)
//! calls it and contributes the result as its paint sublist.
//!
//! Node positions come from the graph's committed positions today (matching the
//! current canvas's `scene_from_graph`). When the seiche field-physics layer is
//! live, a force coupling moves a node and updates its position; this reprojects
//! from the same accessor, so the producer is unchanged. The field's *visual*
//! couplings are resolved here too, via [`crate::coupling_paint`].
