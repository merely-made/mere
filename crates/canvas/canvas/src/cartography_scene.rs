//! Cartography projection-request derivation.
//!
//! Translates platen's reducer-owned graph state into a
//! [`cartography::ProjectionRequest`] and dispatches it through a
//! chosen [`cartography::LayoutStrategy`].
//!
//! Sibling of [`crate::canvas_scene`]: where `canvas_scene` builds a
//! `CanvasSceneInput` for graph-canvas to render directly,
//! `cartography_scene` builds the higher-level `ProjectionRequest`
//! that goes through cartography's strategy contract first — the
//! eventual home for graph-view layout selection (force-directed,
//! radial, phyllotaxis, cluster-collapsed, etc.) once the host wants
//! per-pane strategy choice.
//!
//! ## Two paths, same input shape
//!
//! For new code, prefer [`project_with`] (analytic strategies) over
//! building a `ProjectionRequest` by hand. It sources the right
//! `ViewIntent` / `IntelligenceSignals` shape from
//! [`CartographySceneOptions`] and dispatches through the strategy in
//! one call.
//!
//! `canvas_scene::build_canvas_scene_input` still works for the
//! existing graph-canvas-only render path; the two modules will
//! eventually share infrastructure once cartography becomes the
//! single dispatch surface, but until graph-canvas's existing direct-
//! render path is fully retired they coexist.
