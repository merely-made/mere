//! The physics catalog: `laws × overlays`, and the named profiles over them.
//!
//! A **law** is which dynamics the graph moves under — springs and charges,
//! stress over hop distances, gravity and orbits, particle-life kinds, a
//! flock, coupled oscillators, a magnetic field, annealing, or none. Not a
//! tuning of one force-directed rule but a different rule. An **overlay** is
//! one more pull or push composed onto any law (hub room, group pull, depth,
//! grid, a centre, a tide, the skeleton). A **profile** is a named (law,
//! overlays) pair; the donor Graphshell's ten presets return as the first
//! ten, and a bare profile per law puts every law one pick away.
//!
//! A **source** is where a law or overlay reads a node attribute from: the
//! Kinds law's kind and Group pull's groups (site, cluster, colouring, island,
//! degree, meaning), Orbit's mass and the hub overlays' weight (degree,
//! PageRank), the Depth overlay's depth (roots, layers, the focus). Sources
//! are tunables, not laws; each is a channel of the registry in
//! [`channels`](crate::canvas::channels).
//!
//! The canvas builds the seiche force set from the chosen law + overlays
//! against the current graph and hands it to the physics backend wholesale —
//! the coupling / affinity / anchor slots are separate and untouched. The
//! attribute builders run over a petgraph view of the *visible* edges
//! ([`LawInputs`]), so hidden relations relax the physics as they relax the
//! springs. The choice rides the saved scene by id. Sibling to the
//! arrangement catalog in [`cartography_scene`](crate::canvas::cartography_scene):
//! that is *where* nodes go, this is *how* they move.
//!
//! Plan: `design_docs/mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-09-02_physics_catalog_plan.md`.
