//! Cartography geometry — the canvas's settled-layout read surface.
//!
//! Moved from platen's `projection_geometry` in the 2026-07-09 platen
//! decomposition: this is graph-scene material (member-keyed world positions
//! plus the per-member representation overrides), so it lives with the canvas;
//! platen keeps the Tree (pane) geometry. The host persists it as the
//! `arrangement.*` facet family (pandect `arrangement_facets`, in
//! `facets.json`) — the planned bespoke sidecar file was obviated by the facet
//! convergence before any host wired it.
