//! Ambient-sim backdrops: small standalone simulations painted behind the graph for liveliness the
//! rapier solver should not carry (the "ambient separate-sim backdrop" tier, physics scenes P5).
//!
//! **Ambient is the subtype, not the family** (ruled 2026-08-03, games-wing taxonomy round). A
//! *backdrop* names where a layer sits: behind the actors. It does not promise passivity - a
//! backdrop may carry props with hulls and fields with physical implications, projecting world
//! truth the simulation reasons about. An *ambient background* is the non-interactive subtype:
//! pure context, nothing in it collides, exerts, or answers. Everything in this module is
//! ambient. An interactive backdrop is not a richer AmbientSim; it is a projection of world
//! state and enters through a scene lane, not this seam.
//! Non-rapier and host-side (cheap, no actor offload), advanced and painted each frame as the bottom
//! backdrop layer. They share the [`AmbientSim`] seam (advance + paint), so the canvas holds one
//! `Box<dyn AmbientSim>` and the catalog grows without touching the host. Each is painted in a
//! [`Tincture`] - a base colour it interprets as it likes.
//!
//! One sim per file: [`GameOfLife`] (a CA), [`NBody`] (a Keplerian galaxy drift), [`ParticleLife`]
//! (asymmetric-attraction species), [`SandFall`] (a gravity CA). The shared trait, the [`Tincture`]
//! type, and the tiny PRNG + HSV helpers live here; the sims reach them via `super::`.
