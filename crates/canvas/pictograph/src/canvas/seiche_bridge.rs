//! The graph ↔ seiche adapters — the canvas-side bridge that keeps seiche
//! kernel-free (S0 of the spatial completion): seiche takes plain
//! `(NodeKey, …)` lists and force values; everything that reads a kernel
//! [`Graph`] to produce them lives here. Split out of `build.rs` (which keeps
//! the DOM/paint construction helpers) when that file neared the workspace
//! size ceiling; this module also hosts the graph-resolution tests that were
//! deferred at the seiche extraction (the three `from_coupling` tests removed
//! with seiche's `kernel-bridge` feature).
