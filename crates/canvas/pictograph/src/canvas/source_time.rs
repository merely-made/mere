//! Read-only source-time selection for a [`Canvas`](crate::canvas::Canvas).

//! A source cursor chooses a separate historical canvas. The live canvas remains
//! owned and untouched underneath it, so returning to live restores the exact
//! current presentation instead of replaying or mutating graph truth. Hosts own
//! their source labels, scrubber controls, and subscriptions; this type only
