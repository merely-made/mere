//! The off-thread **community-detection lane**: an [`armillary`] actor that runs Louvain on a
//! `Send` [`CommunitySnapshot`] and emits a revision-stamped [`ClusterSet`]. Mirrors the physics
//! actor (the same off-thread discipline). Used only when the host has supplied an off-thread wake
//! (native + offloaded); on wasm and in tests the canvas computes community inline instead, so this
//! lane is never spun up there. (Graph signals — the background lane, P3.)
//!
//! The `Graph` never crosses the thread: the owner extracts a `Send` [`CommunitySnapshot`] on its
//! own thread, sends it, and the worker computes the partition. A result computed against a
//! since-superseded graph is rejected by **revision** on arrival (stale-rejection), so a layout or
//! ring never paints a partition that no longer matches the graph.
