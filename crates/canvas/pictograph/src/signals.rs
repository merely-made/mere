//! Graph-structural **signal producer** — the graph-signals-layer plan's `intel/signals`.
//!
//! Computes per-node / per-pair signals from the kernel [`Graph`] and hands them to
//! cartography's narrow [`IntelligenceSignals`] contract. This crate OWNS the production
//! lifecycle; cartography keeps only the contract (so cartography never depends on a producer).
//!
//! First signal: **degree-based importance** — a cheap, synchronous signal computed inline. The
//! generation + per-signal dirty-bit **cache** (that gates recomputation and backgrounds the
//! expensive signals: betweenness / communities / affinity) and those richer signals land in
//! later slices; this slice is the spine (producer -> snapshot -> `project_orrery_strategy`).
//! (Graph signals — P1.)
