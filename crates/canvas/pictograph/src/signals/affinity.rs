//! Structural (Jaccard) affinity scoring.

use super::*;

/// Pairwise **structural affinity** — the [Jaccard similarity] of node neighbourhoods,
/// `J(a, b) = |N(a) ∩ N(b)| / |N(a) ∪ N(b)|` over the distinct undirected neighbours of each node.
/// Two nodes score high when they share many neighbours, so structurally-equivalent nodes are
/// "similar" **even when they share no direct edge** — the signal that lets the affinity force draw
/// a community into a tight cluster (where seiche's `EdgeSpring` force only binds adjacent
/// pairs). This is the cheap, dependency-free structural stand-in for the later content-embedding
/// cosine affinity; both ride the same [`AffinityScores`] channel.
///
/// Only pairs whose affinity is `>= min_affinity` are emitted (and only pairs sharing at least one
/// neighbour can be non-zero), so the list stays sparse — its length tracks the graph's clustering,
/// not `n²`. Output is sorted by node-key pair, so the signal is reproducible run to run.
///
/// Note the star case: every leaf of a hub shares exactly that hub, so all leaf pairs score `1.0`
/// (they are structurally identical). That is the metric's honest answer — leaves of one hub *are*
/// a cluster — and the attract-only force settles them at its rest length rather than collapsing
/// them. (Graph signals — P4, the affinity signal.)
