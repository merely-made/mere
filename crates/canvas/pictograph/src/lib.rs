//! **pictograph** derives node faces: a content address in, a compact vector
//! face out.
//!
//! A pictograph writes a picture. From a node's content address this derives a
//! small symmetric mark, encoded as IconVG bytes by
//! [`emblem`](https://crates.io/crates/emblem). Every peer derives the same
//! face for the same content, so a face never has to be shipped — and when one
//! is shipped it is a couple of hundred bytes.
//!
//! # Three properties, and how each is obtained
//!
//! **Deterministic.** The same address always gives the same bytes, on every
//! machine and in every process. The derivation reads its entropy from a
//! fixed hash of the address, uses only integer arithmetic, and encodes
//! through emblem, which guarantees the same at its layer. Faces can therefore
//! be content-addressed themselves, and two peers agree without talking.
//!
//! **Themeable.** Fills name *palette slots*, never literal colours. IconVG
//! pre-loads its registers from the palette the decoder's caller supplies, and
//! at the starting `SEL` of 56 the slot `8 + k` addresses register `k`, which
//! holds custom palette entry `k`. So a face is themed by re-decoding it
//! against a different palette — no re-derivation, no stored variants, and no
//! register ops in the file at all. A literal colour anywhere here would be a
//! bug, not a shortcut.
//!
//! **Scale-aware.** Each face carries two arms behind a level-of-detail
//! branch: a coarse 3x3 silhouette when drawn small, the full 5x5 figure when
//! drawn large. At Canvas's normal 25.92px face height, every coarse cell is
//! 8.1px wide. The decoder picks; the caller does nothing.
//!
//! # Versioning
//!
//! [`DERIVATION_VERSION`] is mixed into the seed, so bumping it changes every
//! face everywhere. That is a deliberate, visible act — every node in every
//! session changes appearance — and never a side effect of tidying this code.
//! Changing the grammar, the parameter mapping, or the geometry without
//! bumping it is the actual mistake, because two peers on different versions
//! would then derive different bytes and silently disagree.
