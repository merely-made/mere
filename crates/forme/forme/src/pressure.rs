//! Origin-aware resource-pressure policy for large formes.
//!
//! The forme has no capacity limit (thousands of members are normal), but
//! runtime resources (WebViews, GL contexts, DOM state) are finite. This
//! module provides a policy layer that queries the forme by origin/domain
//! grouping and produces lifecycle demotion actions to keep resource
//! consumption bounded.
//!
//! Named `pressure` rather than `memory_policy` because the "memory" layer
//! in Mere is owned by [`eidetic`](https://crates.io/crates/eidetic) — this
//! module is about resource pressure (active+warm budget vs. demotion
//! recommendations), not memory.
//!
//! Key principles:
//!
//! - **The tree doesn't own origin data.** Origin is graph truth. The host
//!   supplies an `origin_of` classifier at policy evaluation time.
//! - **Policy produces `NavAction`s, not mutations.** The tree's normal
//!   `apply()` pipeline handles all transitions, preserving intents and
//!   consistency.
//! - **Cold is cheap.** Demoting to Cold preserves topology, provenance,
//!   and subgraph membership. Only runtime resources are freed.
//! - **No hard capacity limits.** Policy is advisory — it recommends
//!   demotions, the host decides whether to apply them.
