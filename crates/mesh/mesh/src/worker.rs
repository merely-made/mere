//! The worker's decision function.
//!
//! [`next_action`] is pure — board, identity, and what this host is offering
//! *at one reading of its clock* in; one action out — so the loop is testable
//! without networking or sleeping. The host drives it: the `mesh-peer` bin now,
//! turnstone's compute actor later.
//!
//! The priority order is the whole social contract. Owner reclaim comes first
//! and is not negotiable; keeping a lease alive comes before doing more work;
//! finishing what you hold comes before taking on more. A device never claims
//! work it cannot run, and never keeps work its owner has asked for back.
//!
//! Execution itself lives in [`crate::registry`]: one route for every wire
//! generation.
