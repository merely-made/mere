//! The job board — a deterministic, order-independent fold of mesh operations.
//!
//! Every peer folds the same op set into the same board, regardless of arrival
//! order (the `Ledger` pattern): the fold *gathers* posts, claims, and results
//! first, then *resolves*. The two resolution rules that make convergence hold:
//!
//! - **Claim races resolve by lowest claim-operation hash.** Two devices may
//!   both claim a job before either sees the other's claim; every peer picks
//!   the same winner because the winner is a pure function of the claim set,
//!   not of arrival order. (Lapse / reassign on a dead winner is milestone 3.)
//! - **Only the winner's result is accepted.** A `JobDone` from any other
//!   author is ignored, so a losing racer's result cannot fork the board.
//!
//! A job's identity is its posting operation's hash (content-addressed, like
//! everything on the DAG).
