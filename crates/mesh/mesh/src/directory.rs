//! Which device is behind a mesh author key.
//!
//! A mesh operation is signed by a key *derived* from a persona master key
//! (salt [`MESH_AUTHOR_SALT`]), while every transport addresses the master key
//! itself. So "fetch this blob from whoever posted the job" is unanswerable
//! from the board alone: the two keys are different and neither derives the
//! other.
//!
//! The binding already existed. [`personae`](identity) mints a
//! [`DerivedKeyAttestation`]: a statement, signed *by the master*, that this
//! derived key belongs to it. Publishing one on the mesh turns the board into
//! a directory, and it is self-authenticating — no new record format, no
//! trusted third party, nothing to get wrong.
//!
//! Two rules make it safe, and both are checked before the fact is stored:
//!
//! - the master's signature must verify over the mesh-author salt; and
//! - the attested derived key must be the **operation's own author**, so a
//!   device can only ever attest itself. Without that second rule anyone could
//!   publish a true attestation about somebody else and point the ring's blob
//!   fetches at a device of their choosing.
