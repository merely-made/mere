//! Lease vocabulary: the facts a lending device signs, and what the fold keeps.
//!
//! **Authority (settled at the M3a gate).** The job author signs [`LeaseTerms`]
//! into the spec once, at post time. The deterministic claim winner for an
//! epoch then authors its *own* grant, valid only inside that envelope. Author
//! authority is therefore exercised while the author is online and stays valid
//! after it goes away — the alternative, granting each lease by hand, stalls
//! every job whose author closed the lid.
//!
//! **No clocks in the fold.** Every rule here compares one *signed* timestamp
//! with another: a grant for epoch N+1 is admissible when its `granted_at_ms`
//! is at or past epoch N's signed end. Liveness — the only question that needs
//! "now" — lives in [`crate::projection`] and takes the observation time as an
//! argument.
//!
//! **Trusted-ring assumption.** A device could claim with a far-future `at_ms`
//! and reserve later epochs for itself. Inside the own-devices ring that is a
//! misconfiguration, not an attack, and the projection will not treat the
//! matching grant as live until that time actually arrives. The kith plan, which
//! widens the ring beyond one owner, has to revisit it.
