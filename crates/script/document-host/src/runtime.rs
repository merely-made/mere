//! P2.4 — the `register-mod-loader` `WasmModRuntime` bridge.
//!
//! Implements `register-mod-loader`'s `WasmModRuntime` DI trait **without editing
//! that crate** (it is deliberately runtime-free — the trait exists precisely so
//! Wasmtime stays host-side, §11.1). A host wires
//!
//! ```ignore
//! ModRegistry::new().with_wasm_runtime(Arc::new(DocumentScriptRuntime::new(allowed)))
//! ```
//!
//! and every manifest-described `ModType::Wasm` mod flows through the loader's
//! lifecycle into this host:
//!
//! - `activate` — host-policy capability check (refuse before instantiation), map
//!   the manifest to a [`Grant`], build the component instance under that grant,
//!   run the `activate` export, and retain the live instance keyed by `mod_id`.
//! - `deactivate` — run the `deactivate` export on the retained instance and drop
//!   it (store + instance freed).
//!
//! ## The two impedance mismatches, and how they are bridged
//!
//! - **sync trait vs async host.** The trait is sync `&self`; our `document-core`
//!   exports are invoked via `call_async` (so a future `fetch` can suspend a turn,
//!   §11.7-7). We bridge with a per-call [`pollster::block_on`] — a minimal
//!   executor with no global runtime, safe to call from any non-reentrant thread.
//!   With no async import yet, every call completes in a single poll.
//! - **`Send + Sync` trait vs the per-mod store.** The trait demands `Send + Sync`;
//!   we retain live `Store<ScriptHost>`s behind a `Mutex`. That compiles only
//!   because `ScriptHost` is `Send` (genet's `ScriptedDom` is an id-keyed arena of
//!   `HashMap`/`Vec`, its `QualName`s string-cache atoms — no `Rc`/`RefCell`). If
//!   that ever regresses, the fallback is a dedicated worker thread; for now the
//!   live store rides in the runtime directly.
//!
//! ## Capability policy (the load-bearing check)
//!
//! The `document-core` world exposes `log` + `document`; both are world-intrinsic
//! for a document mod, so [`grant_for`] grants both. The manifest's host
//! `ModCapability`s (Network / Filesystem / Identity / Clipboard / Exec) gate
//! *host* capabilities that map to future imports (Network → `fetch`); none has a
//! live import yet, so they do not change the grant. They are not inert, though:
//! a runtime is constructed with the set of capabilities its **surface** will
//! grant, and `activate` refuses — before any instantiation — a mod requesting a
//! capability outside that set. That is the host-policy enforcement point (§11.4):
//! a surface that will not grant `Network` rejects a `Network` mod up front.
