//! Builds the two WASM guest components the integration tests load.
//!
//! The guests (`guest/`, `guest-bomb/`) are standalone workspaces compiled to
//! `wasm32-wasip2`. Before this script existed they had to be built by hand, so a
//! fresh checkout or a CI runner failed four tests until someone read the panic
//! message and ran two commands. Nothing about that was machine-specific, it was
//! just manual.
//!
//! The tests resolve the artifacts by a path relative to the package root (cargo
//! runs tests with the CWD set there), overridable via `DOC_HOST_GUEST_WASM` /
//! `DOC_HOST_BOMB_WASM`. This script only has to make sure the artifacts exist at
//! those paths, so it needs no cooperation from the tests.
//!
//! If the `wasm32-wasip2` target is missing, this warns and moves on rather than
//! failing the build: the library itself does not need wasm, and the tests already
//! fail loudly, naming the exact command to run. A missing guest must never become
//! a silently-skipped test.
