//! The `app-core` component host — the ENVELOPE lane (ruled with Mark
//! 2026-07-23).
//!
//! A component that wants to act on the host app imports one interface:
//! `actions.emit(action-envelope)`, where the envelope is `{name, payload}`.
//! The app's WHOLE action surface is reachable through it — there is no
//! curated per-action interface, because a curated interface would be a
//! second authority that can drift from the gate's, and would change shape
//! every time an action is added (so a pack compiled against one install
//! could not run on another). One envelope is one stable ABI; the grant is
//! the only thing that varies.
//!
//! What decides an emission is therefore NOT this crate. This host is
//! app-agnostic: it moves the envelope across the boundary and hands it to a
//! host-supplied [`ActionSink`], which decodes it, classifies it into a
//! capability RING, and checks the emitting denizen's grant (turnstone's `ring`
//! module). A [`Refusal`] comes straight back to the guest as a typed error,
//! so a component learns "denied: session" synchronously rather than trapping
//! or silently no-op'ing.
//!
//! The sink COLLECTS; it never re-enters the app. A host function cannot hold
//! `&mut App` while the app is inside a wasm call, so an allowed emission is
//! queued in the sink and the app drains it after the turn returns — the same
//! shape the piccolo lane already uses (evaluate, collect Actions, lower them
//! through the ordinary spine under the denizen's author).
//!
//! Containment mirrors document-host: [`guarded_engine`] turns on epoch
//! interruption, [`Watchdog`] bumps the epoch so a runaway turn hits its
//! deadline, and `StoreLimits` caps allocation. A misbehaving component traps;
//! the host survives.
