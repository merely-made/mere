//! The `app-core` test guest: a component that acts on the host app through
//! the action ENVELOPE, and reports what came back.
//!
//! It deliberately tries things it should not be allowed to do — an
//! out-of-ring action, gate management (the self-escalation attempt), an
//! action name this host does not know, and a malformed payload — and logs
//! each typed refusal. That is the point of the contract: a denial is a value
//! the component can read and adapt to, not a trap.
