//! Standing event grammar — the authoritative layer.
//!
//! Standing-affecting events are signed operations on the event-DAG (the same
//! wire as murm posts, addressed by space). This module is the *logical* event
//! form — the decoded shape the [ledger](super::ledger) folds — decoupled from
//! the operation wire, which a later phase bridges exactly as Murm's
//! `Post` ↔ `Operation`.
//!
//! **No negative is ever self-issued.** A lapse (silent disappearance past a
//! commitment's cadence) is *derived* by the ledger from missing heartbeats,
//! never self-reported. A [`Censure`](StandingEvent::Censure) and its forgiveness
//! [`Pardon`](StandingEvent::Pardon) are issued by a moot's *governance*, never by
//! the subject. So a persona can neither make themselves look bad nor clear their
//! own bad standing; both directions come from outside them. (Governance
//! authorisation is an ingestion concern, like signature validation; the fold
//! trusts the events it is handed, but defensively ignores a self-judgement where
//! `by == target`.)
//!
//! Fractions are basis points (`u16`, `0..=10_000`), not floats: the score is
//! computed by every peer independently, so the math must be deterministic
//! across platforms.
