//! The moot roster — a deterministic, order-independent fold of moot events.
//!
//! Every member folds the same op set into the same roster regardless of
//! arrival order (the rule the mesh board proved): gather first, then
//! resolve.
//!
//! - **Competing declarations resolve by lowest declaring-op hash** — one
//!   founding, the same on every member, a pure function of the op set.
//! - **First join per author wins** — re-joins and label changes don't
//!   churn membership (a rename event is a later milestone).
//! - **Fauna order is `(at_ms, op_hash)`** — stable everywhere, ties broken
//!   content-addressably.
