//! The moot authorization seam over the TYPED capability vocabulary — the
//! capability-model round's OQ3 unification (ruled 2026-07-24: unify, on the
//! trait, when the caller exists; this is that caller).
//!
//! Both tiers already speak personae's signed delegation certificates: the
//! denizen tier through `servitor::DelegationTable`, the moot tier through
//! [`MootDelegations`]. What they did NOT share until now is the capability
//! vocabulary. [`MootGroup`]'s provider answers `capability_covers` from the
//! member's access level and **ignores the request's path entirely**, so a
//! Write member covers every capability — membership standing in for
//! authority.
//!
//! [`TypedMootAuthorization`] closes that: the request's `capability_path`
//! is parsed as a shared [`Cap`] **at the seam** (D2's rule — strings are
//! parsed at boundaries, never compared inside a decision) and answered from
//! the moot's delegation certificates through the same `power/...` /
//! `scope/...` encoding servitor writes. A moot capability check and a
//! denizen capability check are now the SAME question in the SAME vocabulary
//! against the SAME certificate grammar; the two tiers differ only in where
//! chains root (a constitution grant here, the profile identity there).
//!
//! The unification runs BOTH directions, one type per seam:
//!
//! - [`TypedMootAuthorization`] is the **moot-facing** face: it answers
//!   gemot's own [`MootAuthorizationProvider`] seam from typed capabilities.
//! - [`MootAuthority`] is the **servitor-facing** face: it presents direct
//!   constitutional grants and moot certificates as a
//!   [`servitor::AuthorityProvider`], so a moot peer's
//!   petition runs through the very `servitor::Gate` a script's and a wasm
//!   component's do. That is the participant-gate doctrine's third actor
//!   kind, and it needs no new gate — only this adapter.
//!
//! Typed means typed: a certificate issued with a raw path (`moot/fauna`)
//! does not answer a typed request, and a bare-string request parses as the
//! scope it always was — never accidentally a power. Moots that have not
//! adopted the typed vocabulary keep [`MootGroup`]'s membership provider or
//! raw [`MootDelegations::covers`]; there is no silent bridge between the
//! vocabularies, because a silent bridge is the F1 ambiguity again.
