//! Inter-moot reciprocity credits — Phase 5 (the t3 ILL facet).
//!
//! The federation's give-and-take, kept as credits rather than cash. A moot earns
//! standing with a peer by *providing* for it (hosting a service, pinning a
//! cluster) and spends that standing by *requesting* the same. A moot that only
//! takes runs up an unreciprocated debt and is cut off — it loses privileges, not
//! money (moot tiers §7). It is a sibling of the reputation ledger on the same
//! event idea, keyed by moot pair rather than persona.
