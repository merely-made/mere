//! The commons spine: a chartulary container graph as a replicated domain.
//!
//! M3 of the Commons multi-writer convergence plan, promoted when Turnstone
//! became its first intended place consumer. A chartulary `Batch` is not a
//! p2panda `Operation`, so a graph edit needs this profile to ride a lane.
//!
//! ## The shape
//!
//! One journal batch is one signed operation. The container id is the signed
//! addressing extension, so a batch for one container cannot replay into
//! another. Each replica writes its own per-author log, which is what p2panda
//! reconciles.
//!
//! ## Why receipt does not apply edits
//!
//! The obvious `accept` closure applies each received batch to a live
//! `GraphLog` as it arrives. That does not converge. The merge rules settled
//! in M1/M2 require one deterministic fold, and a live drain delivers in
//! *arrival* order, which differs per peer.
//!
//! So receipt only **stores**, and the graph is a fold over the store in
//! causal order ([`Replica::materialize`]). Per-author backlinks plus the
//! signed observed frontier preserve happens-before across writers; the
//! canonical `(verifying_key, log_id, seq_num)` order breaks ties only between
//! concurrent records. This is the same "recorded fact versus derived state"
//! split the statement kernel brief draws: the log accumulates, the graph is
//! recomputed.
