//! Composite reputation, Phase 5 (federation, t3): a viewer moot's lens over its
//! own and its concorded moots' standing.
//!
//! Reputation is per-moot primary: a persona's standing lives in each moot's own
//! [`Ledger`] (Phase 1 accrual + the Phase 2 depreciation). There is no single
//! global score. A *concord* is a one-directional agreement in which a viewer
//! moot honours another moot's reputations at a weight; a viewer's **composite**
//! reputation for a persona folds its own standing together with its concorded
//! moots' standings, under a composition policy the viewer chooses.
//!
//! Two invariants keep it safe:
//!
//! - **One hop, no transitive trust.** A moot honours its direct concords, never
//!   its concords' concords — otherwise reputation launders down a chain of
//!   agreements (the classic web-of-trust failure). So a junk moot's inflation
//!   reaches only the moots that *directly* chose to concord it, and a moot that
//!   concords junk pollutes its own view, which makes the guard self-policing.
//! - **The composition rule is the moot operator's choice**, not a project
//!   default ([`CompositionPolicy`]). Mere ships the set; the community picks how
//!   trusting or cautious it is.
//!
//! Schema note: composing standings across moots assumes they share (or have
//! normalised) their `StandingConfig` — a score computed under different weights
//! is not comparable, so a real rep concord carries a schema concord. Phase 5
//! composes the numbers and leaves that gating to the federation layer.
