//! The standing projection — folds events into a per-chain-root score.
//!
//! Standing is event-sourced: the signed events are authoritative, the score is
//! a projection (the same content-authoritative / experience-derived rule the
//! rest of the substrate follows). The fold is **deterministic** — integer math
//! only, no floats — so every peer computing it over the same events and the
//! same clock agrees.
//!
//! Lapse is derived here, not emitted: a commitment with no heartbeat for longer
//! than its cadence is lapsed *as of a given clock*, so [`Ledger::scores`] takes
//! `now_ms` and the stick falls out of the projection. A commitment can recover
//! (lapse-and-revive): heartbeating again advances its liveness, so it is no
//! longer lapsed as of a later clock.
