//! Portable host-to-runtime intents.
//!
//! Host adapter files (`iced_app.rs`, `iced_host.rs`, etc.) are
//! forbidden by the sanctioned-writes contract (§12.17) from calling
//! the canonical typed-mutation entrypoints
//! (`apply_graph_delta_and_sync`, `apply_arrangement_snapshot`)
//! directly. The prescribed path is: hosts produce `HostIntent`s, the
//! runtime translates them to internal reducer actions during its
//! `tick` pass.
//!
//! `HostIntent` lives in `kernel` so `FrameHostInput` (also
//! core) can carry a `Vec<HostIntent>`. This is deliberately a
//! **parallel portable enum** — not a move of the shell crate's
//! `GraphIntent` into core. Hosts only need a small surface of intent
//! variants (what the user can express through chrome); the larger
//! `GraphIntent` surface (with PendingTileOpenMode, workbench layout
//! commands, etc.) stays shell-side because it references types the
//! host doesn't need to know about.
//!
//! The runtime translates `HostIntent` → internal actions. Variants
//! whose internal equivalents haven't landed yet route through
//! whatever the runtime currently supports (e.g. `CreateNodeAtUrl`
//! goes through `GraphBrowserApp::add_node_and_sync`, the same path
//! the egui toolbar uses today but via the port contract instead of
//! a direct call).
