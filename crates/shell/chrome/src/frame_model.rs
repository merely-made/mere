//! Portable view-model + host-input types at the runtime ↔ host
//! boundary.
//!
//! Pre-M4 slice 8 (2026-04-22) these types lived in
//! `shell/desktop/ui/frame_model.rs` alongside `FrameViewModel`. Slice
//! 8 extracted the view-model *children* (focus / toolbar / omnibar
//! / graph-search / command-palette / dialogs / toasts /
//! degraded-receipts projections) and `FrameHostInput` to graphshell-
//! core; the shell re-exports from the original path.
//!
//! The top-level `FrameViewModel` aggregate remains shell-side for now
//! because one of its fields (`overlays: Vec<OverlayStrokePass>`)
//! depends on egui-coupled compositor descriptors that haven't been
//! extracted yet. That's a follow-on slice.
//!
//! Time representation: [`FocusRingSpec.started_at`](FocusRingSpec) is a
//! [`PortableInstant`] — the host supplies monotonic ms-from-origin
//! timestamps via [`FrameHostInput`]; the runtime never asks the
//! platform "what time is it now".
