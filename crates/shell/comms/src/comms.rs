//! [`Comms`] — the unified comms model over a set of backend adapters.
//!
//! Holds a `Vec<Box<dyn ProtocolAdapter>>` and presents them as one inbox:
//! [`inbox`](Comms::inbox) merges every adapter's conversations (recency-sorted)
//! and surfaces, rather than hides, any backend that failed;
//! [`messages`](Comms::messages) and [`send`](Comms::send) route to the owning
//! adapter by [`ProtocolKind`].
