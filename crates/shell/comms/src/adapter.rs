//! The seam between the comms model and a backend.
//!
//! A [`ProtocolAdapter`] presents one backend (a misfin mailbox, a murm cabal
//! set) as conversations, messages, and an identity, and accepts a [`Draft`] to
//! send. [`Comms`](crate::Comms) holds a set of adapters and merges them into one
//! unified view, routing per-conversation operations to the owning adapter by
//! [`ProtocolKind`].
//!
//! The trait is `async` and object-safe (via `async_trait`) so the host can hold
//! a heterogeneous `Vec<Box<dyn ProtocolAdapter>>` and light each protocol up as
//! its backend matures.
