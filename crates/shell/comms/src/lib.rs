//! # comms
//!
//! Graphshell domain module — a host-neutral comms model for the Mere browser.
//!
//! It names the shapes the comms pane renders ([`Conversation`], [`Message`],
//! [`Identity`], [`Draft`]) and the [`ProtocolAdapter`] seam that turns a backend
//! into them. [`Comms`] holds a set of adapters and presents them as one inbox,
//! routing per-conversation operations to the backend that owns each.
//!
//! The core (this model + the trait) is WASM-clean: no egui, no tokio runtime, no
//! platform I/O, testable without booting a host. The concrete backends live
//! behind features — `murm-adapter` and `misfin-adapter` — because they pull
//! async transports a wasm build of the bare model should not.
//!
//! ```
//! # use comms::Comms;
//! # async fn demo() {
//! // Backends are added with `.with_adapter(...)`; an empty model is a valid,
//! // quiet inbox. (The in-memory and real adapters live behind features.)
//! let comms = Comms::new();
//! let inbox = comms.inbox().await;
//! assert!(inbox.conversations.is_empty());
//! assert!(inbox.failures.is_empty());
//! # }
//! ```
