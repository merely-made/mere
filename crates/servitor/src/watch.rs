//! Standing subscriptions: **when** a denizen runs.
//!
//! [`gate`](crate::gate) answers "may it write". This module answers the other
//! half: a **watch** is a scope whose committed changes wake a denizen's body,
//! so a helper can react to the world instead of waiting to be invoked.
//!
//! Three properties, each enforced here rather than left to a host:
//!
//! 1. **The containment law.** A watch must sit inside what its subject may
//!    already read: registration asks the [`AuthorityProvider`] and refuses
//!    otherwise. You cannot be woken by what you cannot read, so a watch can
//!    never become a side channel for observing a region a grant excludes.
//! 2. **No self-waking.** An entry authored by the watcher never matches that
//!    watcher's own watch. The trivial loop is unrepresentable rather than
//!    merely budgeted, which matters because the budget is the *last* line of
//!    defence and should only ever catch genuine mutual cascades.
//! 3. **Cursors, not replays.** Each watch remembers the last journal position
//!    it has seen. Waking is "what happened since", and a wake advances the
//!    cursor past everything considered, matched or not, so an unmatched entry
//!    is never rescanned.
//!
//! **The matcher is tier-agnostic on purpose.** It consumes [`WatchEvent`]s
//! (a sequence number, an author label, the scopes an entry touched) rather
//! than any one journal type, because the stack has two journals with two
//! different author conventions for the same identity:
//!
//! | journal | author label | set by |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | chartulary (a denizen's nested world) | `denizen:abcd1234` | [`Subject::to_author`] |
//! | mere's `GraphJournal` (the main graph) | the full 64-char hex | turnstone `remote_projection.rs` |
//!
//! Deriving the self-author here would therefore be right on one tier and
//! wrong on the other, and being wrong means the self-wake refusal silently
//! stops working. So [`WatchTable::register`] takes the label as an argument:
//! a caller cannot register a watch without stating which convention its
//! journal uses.
//!
//! **Scope shape is the caller's problem, and it is a real one.** Matching is
//! segment-prefix over [`ScopePath`], which fits a nested world (whose node
//! ids *are* scope paths, the same strings the gate scope-checks). Mere's main
//! graph keys nodes by `Uuid`, and a UUID is a single opaque segment, so
//! against that journal only an exact-node watch or the root scope can match
//! anything. Watching a *region* of the main graph needs a region vocabulary
//! that does not exist yet (container membership, address prefix, and tag are
//! the candidates); see the graph behaviors plan. Nothing here blocks it: a
//! main-graph adapter is another producer of [`WatchEvent`]s.
