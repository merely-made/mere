//! Cascades: how far one wake is allowed to travel.
//!
//! A woken body commits; its commits can wake other watches; those wake more.
//! That chain is a **cascade**, and left alone it is the failure mode of every
//! reactive system: two helpers that each react to the other, running until
//! something gives. This module is what gives, deliberately and out loud.
//!
//! Four properties hold it together, and only the last one is a limit:
//!
//! 1. **No self-waking**, from [`Watch`](crate::watch::Watch): the trivial
//!    one-body loop cannot even be expressed, so a budget is never spent on it.
//! 2. **Cursors advance**, so an entry considered in an earlier round is not a
//!    candidate in a later one. A cascade cannot re-chew its own history.
//! 3. **Stable order**, inherited from [`WatchTable::wake`]: rounds run their
//!    subjects in key order, so the same inputs produce the same run order and
//!    a recorded cascade replays.
//! 4. **A bounded round count**, the [`CascadeBudget`]. Reaching it is not a
//!    silent truncation: the outcome names the subjects still waking each
//!    other, so a host can say which behaviors are fighting rather than
//!    reporting that something vague went wrong.
//!
//! The budget is a **setting** (ruled 2026-08-13). There is deliberately no
//! unlimited value: an unbounded cascade is precisely the condition the budget
//! exists to name, so offering a way to switch the naming off would be
//! offering a way to hang the application quietly.
//!
//! This module runs no bodies. The host supplies a runner closure, because
//! what "run a denizen" means (a piccolo script under a step budget, a wasm
//! component, a scenario step) is the host's business, and because a headless
//! cascade is testable while an embedded one is not.
