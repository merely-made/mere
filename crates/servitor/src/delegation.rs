//! Delegation: the one mechanism behind install, expiry, and revocation —
//! **personae's signed certificates, viewed through the typed capability**.
//!
//! The capability-model round's D3 ruling (2026-07-24): the user is not an
//! implicit infinite authority that "writes some grants" — the user is a
//! **root subject**, and everything else is delegation from it. Install is an
//! attenuating delegation; expiry is a delegation with a bound; revocation is
//! severing one, cascading to its subtree.
//!
//! **This module owns none of that machinery.** `personae::delegation` already
//! provides the whole signed grammar — [`DelegationCertificate`] with
//! `attenuates` / `covers`, chain parents, expiry bounds, delegation depth,
//! content-addressed ids, `DelegationRevocation`, and the derived-key identity
//! proof beneath it — and gemot's moot store already consumes it. Servitor
//! contributes exactly one thing personae lacks: the **typed capability**
//! ([`Cap`], with its closed-set powers and hierarchical scopes) as a view over
//! personae's `(path_prefix, actions)` pair. One delegation system, two tiers.
//!
//! ## How a `Cap` becomes a personae scope
//!
//! personae's [`CapabilityScope`] is two-dimensional — *where*
//! (`path_prefix`, matched with a slash boundary) and *what* (`actions`, a set
//! attenuated by subset). A [`Cap`] encodes into the path, and [`Mode`] into
//! the actions:
//!
//! | servitor | personae `path_prefix` | personae `actions` |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `Cap::Power("navigate")` at `Write` | `power/navigate` | `{read, write}` |
//! | `Cap::Scope("scenario/a")` at `Read` | `scope/scenario/a` | `{read}` |
//! | `Cap::Facet("web")` at `Write` | `facet/web` | `{read, write}` |
//!
//! Both halves of the capability order survive the encoding:
//!
//! - **powers stay closed** — personae's `path_covers` requires a `/`
//!   boundary, so `power/nav` does not cover `power/navigate`, and no power
//!   has anything beneath it;
//! - **scopes stay hierarchical** — `scope/scenario` covers
//!   `scope/scenario/a`, which is what a scope is for;
//! - **modes stay ordered** — a `Write` grant carries `{read, write}`, so
//!   subset attenuation reproduces `Write` covering `Read` without personae
//!   knowing the ordering.
