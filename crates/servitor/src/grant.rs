//! Scoped structural capabilities and the authority seam.
//!
//! A [`Grant`] is a structural capability: a [`Subject`] may act under a
//! [`Cap`] with a [`Mode`]. This is the layer-1 structural cap of the designed
//! three-layer stack (structural cap + policy facts + group-key). Coverage is
//! the partial order the capability type owns (see [`crate::cap`]), never a
//! string test here. The [`AuthorityProvider`] is the replaceable read
//! boundary that answers coverage, so a meadowcap-shaped provider over
//! graph-cluster-derived namespaces can replace [`GrantTable`] without the
//! gate changing.
