//! Capability-scoped resident helpers for graph applications.
//!
//! Terminology (2026-09-20): participant is the platform admission role;
//! denizen belongs to Isometry's simulation vocabulary. Existing wire and
//! persisted spellings, including `mere.denizen` and `denizen:`, are stable.
//!
//! A **participant** is anything admitted to act on a graph through the gate: a
//! resident helper (a servitor), a script, a scenario runner, a remote peer,
//! an agent. It holds an identity (a keyholder [`Subject`]) and a scoped
//! structural capability, and it proposes changes as **petitions** that the
//! [`gate`] validates against the capability and applies through chartulary's
//! attributed, revision-checked commit. Every applied change is attributed to
//! the participant in the journal.
//!
//! This crate is the participant residency **core**, headless and app-agnostic:
//!
//! - [`Subject`] — a keyholder identity (a 32-byte public key), the same shape
//!   the moot authorization seam uses (`gemot::MootAuthorizationRequest.subject`).
//! - [`cap`] — compatibility re-exports from the dependency-free
//!   `mere-capability` leaf crate: [`Cap`] carries closed powers, node scopes,
//!   and facet namespaces under one coverage order.
//! - [`grant`] — a scoped structural capability ([`Grant`]) and the replaceable
//!   [`AuthorityProvider`] seam that answers "does this subject's capability
//!   cover this one?", mirroring `gemot::MootAuthorizationProvider`.
//! - [`gate`] — the one authority pipeline: refuse petitions that touch a
//!   grant projection, check authority, check scope, then commit attributed.
//! - [`cascade`] — how far a wake travels: a bounded, deterministic rounds
//!   loop over [`watch`]'s wake decisions, ending either settled or naming
//!   the behaviors still answering each other.
//! - [`deadband`] — how often a behavior may actuate: a declared minimum
//!   output change and minimum interval, enforced before another journal
//!   commit and driven by host-supplied time.
//! - [`tick`] — when a participant runs *on the clock*: a schedule rather than a
//!   subscription, because time is not a journal and has no cursor to hold.
//!   The clock is the host's, as it is for grant expiry, so a replay fires the
//!   same behaviors at the same points.
//! - [`watch`] — when a participant runs: a standing subscription to a scope,
//!   contained by what its subject may read, matched against a journal's
//!   committed entries. The gate says whether a body may write; a watch says
//!   what wakes it.
//! - [`resident`] — binding snapshots and run admission for a resident; each
//!   action still passes through its own authoritative gate.
//! - [`run`] — pure reduction of recorded intents, results, budgets and
//!   interruptions; hosts execute work and reconcile uncertain effects.
//!
//! A participant's inner world (its grant projections, storage markers, registered
//! commands, journal cursors) is an ordinary [`chartulary::GraphLog`]: the
//! nested graph a graph-bearing node points at. The gate operates on that
//! nested graph; wiring a participant node in a host graph to bear it is the host's
//! job (mere's `Node` implementing `chartulary::GraphBearing`).
//!
//! The capability model is typed but still small: [`Cap`] carries the three
//! shapes real consumers hold (an app's closed ring set, a graph's unbounded
//! node-id namespace, and a facet namespace), and coverage is the partial
//! order that same type owns. The full model (meadowcap-shaped structural caps over
//! graph-cluster-derived namespaces, binding to leaf node ids) lands when
//! mere's namespace layer is built; this crate consumes an
//! [`AuthorityProvider`], so that richer provider drops in without changing
//! the gate. See the capability model plan (mere design_docs, 2026-07-23) for
//! the order's laws and the delegation/revocation rounds it enables.
