//! The gate: one authority pipeline for every petition.
//!
//! A denizen proposes a **petition** (a batch of [`EditSpec`]s against its
//! nested graph, claiming to act under a [`ScopePath`]). A petition is always
//! scope-claimed, never power-claimed: powers name app abilities, scopes name
//! places in a graph, and only the second can contain a node id. The gate:
//!
//! 1. refuses any spec that would touch a **grant projection** (the reserved
//!    [`GRANT_PREFIX`] namespace) — a denizen can read its grants but never
//!    edit them, so it cannot escalate itself;
//! 2. checks **authority**: the [`AuthorityProvider`] must cover the claimed
//!    path at [`Mode::Write`];
//! 3. checks **scope**: every node a spec touches must fall under the claimed
//!    path;
//! 4. checks **facet authority**: every facet write needs a covering
//!    [`Cap::Facet`] at [`Mode::Write`] as well as node scope;
//! 5. **commits** the batch attributed to the denizen, revision-checked, atomic
//!    (chartulary's `commit_batch`).
//!
//! Authority is materialized elsewhere and *projected* here read-only:
//! [`Gate::project_grant`] renders a [`Grant`] into the nested graph as a
//! reserved-namespace node, committed by the gate's own author, so "what may
//! this denizen do" is a browsable question answered from the graph itself.
