//! The join ceremony over [`SyncedSpace`], owned once.
//!
//! Every LogSync consumer used to hand-write the same sequence: build the
//! session over its store, open a live stream on its topic, subscribe, hand
//! the subscription to [`SyncedSpace::drive`], then keep the session and
//! stream handle alive in drop-order-sensitive fields. Seven copies existed
//! (mesh, murm, gemot's four lane proofs plus its example) and the
//! domain-specific part was three values: the store, the topic, and the
//! `accept` closure. [`JoinedSpace`] is that ceremony as one call.
//!
//! ## Type shape
//!
//! Generic over the extensions `E` only. The store and log-id types are
//! erased at construction (the session is kept alive as an opaque box), so a
//! holder names one type — `JoinedSpace<CabalExt>` — instead of the full
//! `LogSync<Store, LogId, Ext>` triple, and stays `Send + Sync` without
//! hand-rolled keepalive erasure. The cost is that `L` cannot be inferred
//! from a store that implements `LogStore` for every log id (muniment's
//! does), so a call site pins it: `JoinedSpace::join::<_, u64, _, _>(…)`.
//!
//! ## Ownership and drop order
//!
//! Dropping a `JoinedSpace` aborts the drain task first, then closes the
//! stream handle, then stops the session actor — the ordering every copy had
//! to get right by field position is now fixed here once.
