//! The actor harness: run a subsystem on its own thread, talk to it by message.
//!
//! An actor owns possibly-`!Send` internals (a JS engine, a DOM, a layout engine)
//! pinned to its thread. The kernel holds only a `Send` [`ActorHandle`] to send
//! commands and drains a `Receiver` of `Send` updates. The boundary is the GPUI
//! lesson made a function signature: everything that crosses is `Send`; everything
//! pinned stays on its thread.
//!
//! The actor's internals never cross the boundary because [`spawn`] builds them
//! *on the actor thread*: the `run` closure that constructs the engine is the only
//! thing moved, and it captures `Send` build arguments, not `!Send` state.
//!
//! A network fetcher or a sync host is the canonical instance of this shape: own a
//! runtime, push typed updates over a channel plus a wake, and let the kernel drain
//! them on its own thread.
