//! The Graphshell session protocol with the I/O taken out.
//!
//! [`SessionCore`] holds everything [`crate::session::RetainedEndpointSession`]
//! held except the carrier, and answers one question: *given where this session
//! is, what should be asked of the endpoint next, and what does the answer
//! mean?* It never sends anything. A caller drives it by carrying
//! [`Progress::Ask`] to wherever the endpoint is and handing the reply back
//! through [`SessionCore::on_response`].
//!
//! ## Why the protocol had to stop owning its I/O
//!
//! [`chirograph::Carrier`] is blocking, and its own doc defers the question to
//! whoever writes a network carrier. The browser is that moment, and it cannot
//! answer it the way native did: blocking a browser task deadlocks against the
//! very data-channel callback that would deliver the bytes being waited on, and
//! moving the block into a worker only moves the deadlock — a worker parked in
//! `request` has stopped the event loop that delivers the message it is parked
//! on. Escaping that needs `Atomics.wait` on a `SharedArrayBuffer`, which needs
//! cross-origin isolation, which would then be imposed on anyone embedding
//! Graphshell.
//!
//! So the protocol stops owning its I/O instead. This is the shape
//! `notochord`'s handshake and the WebRTC carrier core already have, and the
//! reason str0m was chosen at C1: the sequencing is written once, and how bytes
//! move is somebody else's decision. `RetainedEndpointSession` is the blocking
//! adapter over this core and keeps its public API exactly; the browser writes
//! an event-driven one. Two adapters, one protocol.
//!
//! ## Multi-step operations
//!
//! Three operations are not one round trip, and they are why this is a state
//! machine rather than a pair of functions. Resolving a presentation may need a
//! resource first, and another after that. A resume may be answered with a
//! resynchronize that asks again from a new position, up to
//! [`RESUME_ATTEMPTS`] times. Polling drains however many notices are queued.
//! Each returns [`Progress::Ask`] again rather than looping over a carrier it
//! does not have.
