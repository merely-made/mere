//! The event-driven adapter: [`SessionCore`] over an NDJSON line wire.
//!
//! [`crate::session::RetainedEndpointSession`] is the blocking adapter, which a
//! browser cannot use. This is the other one. It never blocks, never waits, and
//! never touches a socket: a caller asks it what to send, writes that line
//! wherever the endpoint is, and hands back whatever lines come off the wire.
//!
//! ## Why this is not browser code
//!
//! Nothing here knows what a data channel is. The browser's actual glue —
//! `send`, `onmessage` — is a dozen lines in the port, and everything with a
//! rule in it lives here, where it compiles and its tests *run* on an ordinary
//! `cargo test`. That is the same division the WebRTC probe already draws
//! between its `sdp` module and its wasm half, and for the same reason: a rule
//! that can only be exercised in a browser is a rule nobody exercises.
//!
//! ## The wire
//!
//! One JSON value per line, which is what `graphshell-stdio` speaks and what
//! `serve_admitted_session` reads. Outbound lines are [`CarrierRequest`];
//! inbound lines are [`CarrierOutput`], which is untagged and so is either a
//! [`chirograph::CarrierResponse`] carrying an `id` or a [`CarrierNotice`]
//! carrying a
//! session and a revision.
//!
//! ## What this adapter has that the blocking one gets for free
//!
//! Request identity. A blocking carrier reads the answer to the question it
//! just asked, so correlation is implicit in the call stack. Here it is not:
//! lines arrive whenever they arrive, so every request carries an id and a
//! response naming a different one is refused rather than folded into whatever
//! happens to be in flight. That is the difference between a stalled session
//! and a silently wrong one.
