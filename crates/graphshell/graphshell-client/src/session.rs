//! One mounted endpoint over a blocking carrier.
//!
//! The session machinery every native Graphshell host repeats: discover once,
//! mount projections, resolve presentations on demand, submit advertised
//! actions, and recover through resume when a revision bell arrives.
//!
//! It holds a [`Carrier`] as a trait object and never asks which one, which is
//! what makes "an embedded endpoint" and "a remote one" the same code path with
//! a different argument. Constructing the carrier is the host's business: a
//! stdio carrier needs a program to spawn, a network carrier needs a peer to
//! dial and a service to be admitted to, and neither concern belongs to the
//! state machine behind it.
//!
//! ## This is now an adapter, not the protocol
//!
//! The sequencing moved to [`SessionCore`], which owns no carrier and performs
//! no I/O. What remains here is the blocking half: take the request the core
//! asks for, put it to the carrier, hand the answer back, repeat until the core
//! says the operation is done. That loop is `drive`, private to this file,
//! and the only place in it that blocks.
//!
//! The split exists because the browser cannot block — see the [`crate::core`]
//! module doc for why a worker does not rescue it either. Every public method
//! below keeps its exact signature and behaviour, so no native host changes;
//! the browser writes a second, event-driven adapter over the same core.
