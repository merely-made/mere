//! The frozen realization: a scene as navigable semantics.
//!
//! A projection has two realizations, and only one of them is usually built.
//! The interactive one is a canvas a person points at. The frozen one is what
//! remains when the pixels are unavailable or unusable: a screen reader, a
//! text-only client, a printed page, a receipt in a proof. None of the
//! visualization grammars surveyed for the projection grammar report treat that
//! second form as a first-class target, which is why this is built from the W3C
//! anatomy instead: WAI's guidance for complex images, Graphics ARIA's roles,
//! and SVG's structural title/desc pairing.
//!
//! "Frozen" here means noninteractive. The same scene may replace this with
//! an interactive realization; the term does not describe protocol stability
//! or a transport artifact.
//!
//! This module produces a *structure*, not markup. A host renders it into its
//! own accessibility surface, whether that is a genet DOM tree, an AccessKit
//! node tree, or an HTML table, and the same receipt can be asserted in a test
//! without a browser. That also keeps a DOM engine out of the client.
//!
//! Two facts about the contract shape this had to work around, both worth
//! stating where a reader meets them:
//!
//! 1. **A scene carries no names.** [`ProjectedItem`] identifies itself with a
//!    [`SourceRef`], which is an address, not a label. Names live on the
//!    protocol's presentation plane, in `chirograph::PresentationSemantics`,
//!    so a caller supplies them here and the source id is the fallback. A
//!    fallback name is honest but poor, and [`FrozenScene::unnamed`] counts
//!    them so a receipt can say how much of the scene was legible.
//! 2. **Relations name instances, not sources.** They are resolved to names
//!    here so the frozen form never asks a reader to follow an index.
