//! The stream carrier: an endpoint reached across a connection.
//!
//! The third carrier, beside `graphshell-stdio` and `graphshell-local`, and
//! the one that makes remote projection real rather than architectural. It
//! carries the protocol over any byte stream and knows nothing about how that
//! stream was obtained: who dialled, which ALPN they asked for, and whether
//! anyone was admitted are all decided before a [`NetworkCarrier`] exists.
//!
//! That ignorance is the point. Admission vocabulary belongs to the service
//! being reached, so it lives in the port that owns the service, and the
//! carrier stays a carrier. `ports/graphshell`'s `network_carrier` module
//! supplies the projection service's half: the ALPN, the initiator binding,
//! and the dial that produces an admitted stream to hand to [`NetworkCarrier::over`].
//!
//! ## The blocking surface is deliberate
//!
//! [`Carrier`] blocks, and this carrier drives an async stream behind it on a
//! runtime it holds. That was settled when the in-process carrier showed
//! blocking to be a stdio assumption rather than a protocol truth: an async
//! trait would colour every session holder and hub caller above it, to serve
//! one carrier that can perfectly well own its runtime.
//!
//! So the blocking calls below must run on a thread that is not a runtime
//! worker, which is the shape every current caller already has. Calling them
//! from inside an async context panics, which is tokio telling the truth
//! rather than a limitation of this crate.
//!
//! The case that reopens the decision is a browser reaching a *remote*
//! endpoint, where no thread may block. The answer there is an async sibling
//! trait, not a conversion.
//!
//! ## Why it reads [`CarrierOutput`] rather than [`CarrierResponse`]
//!
//! An admitted server loop writes bare responses and stdio writes an envelope,
//! but [`CarrierOutput`] is untagged and its two variants are structurally
//! disjoint, so one decode reads both. That is what lets a notice interleave
//! with responses on a stream that never framed them separately.
