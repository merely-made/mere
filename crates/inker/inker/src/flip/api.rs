//! The engine-agnostic flip contract (was the `verso-api` crate).
//!
//! A *flip* re-presents the same page through a different engine with the user's
//! place and session carried across (see
//! `verso_docs/technical_architecture/2026-06-10_compatibility_view_charter.md`).
//! This module is the engine-agnostic contract: the portable view-state moved across
//! a flip, plus the donor / back / receiver traits. It depends on no engine and no
//! GPU layer. Per-engine adapters ([`crate::flip::scry`], [`crate::flip::genet`], ...) bridge concrete
//! engines to these traits; the [`crate::flip::orchestrator`] orchestrator pairs a donor with a
//! receiver and runs the flip choreography.

/// Which layers of view-state a carrier moves. Layers degrade, never block: a
/// carrier moves `donor.donates() & receiver.receives()`, and any layer outside
/// that intersection is simply dropped.
