//! The flip orchestrator (the carrier; was the `verso` crate).
//!
//! A *flip* re-presents the same page through a different engine, carrying the
//! user's place and session across (charter
//! `verso_docs/technical_architecture/2026-06-10_compatibility_view_charter.md`).
//! This module is the engine-agnostic carrier: it pairs a [`FlipDonor`] with a
//! [`FlipReceiver`] (forward) or a [`FlipBack`] source with a primary receiver
//! (back), masks the view-state down to the layers *both* sides support, and hands
//! the receiver the result. It owns no engine and no GPU layer (it reaches only [`crate::flip::api`]), so a heavy engine only ever lands in the host variant that asked
//! for it, never here.
//!
//! Two invariants live in the type signatures, not in runtime checks:
//!
//! * **Degrade, never block** (charter §3.1): a layer the receiver does not accept
//!   is dropped, not a reason to refuse the flip. [`flip_forward`] / [`flip_back`]
//!   mask by `donor.donates() ∩ receiver.receives()` and always present.
//! * **One hop** (charter §4): [`flip_forward`] takes a [`FlipDonor`] (a glass-box
//!   primary) and [`flip_back`] takes a [`FlipBack`] (a black-box secondary). A
//!   secondary never implements `FlipDonor`, so there is no type path to forward a
//!   document from one secondary to another. A flip is always primary ↔ secondary.
