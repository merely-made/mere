//! The attributed commit seam: every mutation is a [`Batch`] in the journal.
//!
//! B0.5 of the participant gate + packs plan (mere design_docs, 2026-07-17):
//! the journal's entry type is an attributed batch, committed atomically
//! against an expected revision. A petition from any denizen and a keystroke
//! from the trusted UI travel the same path: the UI's convenience mutators on
//! [`GraphLog`] are single-spec commits at the current revision (no conflict
//! possible, no optimistic retry), while a gate calls
//! [`commit_batch`](GraphLog::commit_batch) with the revision it read, and a
//! stale batch is refused wholesale, carrying the current revision to rebase
//! against.
//!
//! Chartulary **attributes**; it does not authenticate. Whether an author may
//! commit what it commits (grants, scopes) is the gate's job, one layer up.
//! App effects (fetch, navigation, windows) cannot roll back, so a consumer
//! enqueues them only after a commit returns, carrying the [`BatchId`];
//! nothing here runs an effect.
//!
//! A batch either applies in full or not at all: the revision is compared and
//! every spec is prechecked against the graph plus the batch's own earlier
//! specs before anything mutates, and the whole batch lands as one journal
//! entry (one slot write on save).
