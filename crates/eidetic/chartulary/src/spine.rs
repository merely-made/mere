//! The edit spine: an event-sourced graph over a muniment journal.
//!
//! [`GraphLog`] is the write side of the graph. Every mutation travels one
//! path: build an attributed [`Batch`], apply it to the materialized graph,
//! append it to a [`Journal`]. The graph is the replay of the log, and because
//! live editing and replay share the same apply, they cannot diverge. The
//! convenience mutators here are single-spec commits at the current revision
//! (the trusted-UI path: attributed, no optimistic retry); a gate commits
//! multi-spec petitions through
//! [`commit_batch`](GraphLog::commit_batch) in [`commit`](crate::commit).
//!
//! Loading has two paths, and they agree:
//! - [`load_full`](GraphLog::load_full): read the log, replay every batch.
//! - [`load_checkpointed`](GraphLog::load_checkpointed): read a snapshot, then
//!   replay only the batches after it.
//!
//! Both migrate pre-gate logs (bare [`GraphEdit`] entries) on load, wrapping
//! each edit as a single-edit batch authored
//! [`Author::pre_gate`](crate::commit::Author::pre_gate).
//!
//! A snapshot is a compacted materialization (the nodes and edges as they
//! stand, plus the edge-id bookkeeping and the log length it reflects), stored
//! in a muniment slot. It is an optimization; the log is the authority.
