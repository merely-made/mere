//! Capability traits.
//!
//! A node needs exactly one thing to live in a [`Graph`](crate::Graph): a stable
//! [`Identified`] identity. Everything else is a *capability* a payload opts into,
//! and each capability unlocks a feature:
//!
//! | trait | on | unlocks |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | [`Addressed`] | node | multi-scheme address lookup, the RDF `@id` |
//! | [`ContentBearing`] | node | a content-addressed body (a muniment blob) |
//! | [`GraphBearing`] | node | a nested graph (borne by log identity, see [`nested`](crate::nested)) |
//! | [`Labeled`] | node | title + tags, the curated RDF literals |
//! | [`Classified`] | edge | relation-class filtering and render policy |
//! | [`Predicated`] | edge | a predicate IRI: the edge joins the semantic ring |
//!
//! The provided [`Container`](crate::Container) / [`Relation`](crate::Relation)
//! payloads implement all of these. An app that needs more implements the traits
//! on its own struct instead (mere's web node does this).
