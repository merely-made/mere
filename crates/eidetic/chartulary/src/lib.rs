//! chartulary (aka **chart**) — the generic content-addressed container graph.
//!
//! A chartulary is the register a house kept its charters and muniments in. This
//! crate is that register for an app's nodes and their relations: a
//! [`Graph<N, E>`] where nodes are content-addressed containers and edges are
//! typed relations, over one shared, app-agnostic model.
//!
//! The design is fully generic. A node needs exactly one capability,
//! [`Identified`], to live in the graph; everything else is an opt-in trait that
//! unlocks a feature ([`Addressed`], [`ContentBearing`], [`GraphBearing`],
//! [`Labeled`] on nodes, [`Classified`] and [`Predicated`] on edges). The provided [`Container`] and
//! [`Relation`] payloads implement them all, so an app can start immediately;
//! mere's web node and isometry's entity implement the traits on their own types
//! instead.
//!
//! chartulary sits above muniment (a node's content is a muniment blob, referenced
//! by hash) and muniment journals (the graph is the replay of its edits).
//! Relations come in two rings: a shared [`Semantic`] ring that projects to RDF,
//! and app-private families that do not (see [`taxonomy`]).
//!
//! G0 is the generic core, the capability traits, the default payloads, and the
//! two-ring taxonomy. **G1** adds the edit spine ([`GraphLog`]): graph mutations
//! are attributed [`Batch`] entries in a journal (each batch a group of
//! [`GraphEdit`]s that applied atomically, committed against an expected
//! revision — see [`commit`]), the graph is the replay, and muniment
//! snapshots give checkpoint-plus-tail loading. The [`stemma`] lineage layer and
//! [`rdf`] semantic-ring projection are part of the crate. The canonical plan is mere's
//! `design_docs/.../2026-07-08_generic_graph_substrate_plan.md`.
//!
//! **Facets** ([`facet`]) are the runtime tier of node metadata, complementing
//! the compile-time capability traits: optional, typed, schema-validated records
//! keyed by node id, so a node carries content-specific metadata (and a modder
//! defines new metadata) without changing the node type. **Content classes**
//! ([`content_class`]) type a node by the facets it carries — the node-side
//! analog of the edge [`taxonomy`] — defined as data so a class ships like any
//! other content. Validation is injected through the
//! [`FacetValidator`](facet::FacetValidator) seam; chartulary stays
//! schema-agnostic. This realizes the one-node ruling (mere design_docs
//! `2026-07-18_one_node_facets_layer_map.md`): `Container` is the node, and
//! everything else is a facet.
