//! Graph edits: the entries of the edit spine.
//!
//! A [`GraphEdit`] is one mutation. A [`Journal`](muniment::Journal) of them is the
//! graph's history; replaying it materializes the graph. Edits reference nodes by
//! their **stable identity** ([`Identified::Id`]), never by an ephemeral graph key,
//! so replay into a fresh graph reconstructs the same result. Edges get a stable
//! [`EdgeId`] at connect time (assigned by the [`GraphLog`](crate::GraphLog) and
//! carried in the edit) so a specific edge can be retracted across replay.
