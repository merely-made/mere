//! Log identity and fork provenance.

//! A log can be forked: the fork copies the history so far and records where it
//! branched from, then diverges independently. This is git-style branching over an
//! append-only log. Two logs that share a fork point are related by their
//! provenance, not by deduplicating their entries.
