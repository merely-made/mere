//! Append-only journals over muniment storage.
//!
//! A [`Journal<T>`] is a linear log of immutable entries you
//! [`append`](Journal::append) and [`replay`](Journal::replay) to reconstruct the
//! state they describe. Edits are never destroyed; a change is a new entry.
//!
//! It is the event-source and nondestructive-history primitive shared across the
//! Merely apps: isometry's session events, strophe's edit history, mere's graph
//! mutations. Each stamps entries with a monotonic [`Seq`] that stays valid for
//! the life of the log, so a reader or peer can hold one as a durable cursor and
//! catch up with [`from`](Journal::from) / [`replay_from`](Journal::replay_from).
//! Journals persist whole through a muniment slot ([`persist`]), or one entry
//! per key so an append is one small write ([`entries`]). They are
//! transport-neutral: shipping the replayable sequence to peers remains the
//! consumer's job.
//!
//! # Storage is a sequence; shape is a graph
//!
//! Entries are a flat, monotonic list, which is what makes append, replay, and
//! persistence cheap. Causality rides beside them as parent links, so a log can
//! also answer what led to an entry, what followed from it, and which entries
//! were genuinely concurrent. Opt in with
//! [`append_caused_by`](Journal::append_caused_by); plain
//! [`append`](Journal::append) claims no causes and behaves exactly as before.
//! See [`causal`] for the invariant that makes this nearly free.
//!
//! This replaces the crate's earlier scope note that a branching edit-tree was
//! a later shape. It is this shape, and it arrived without disturbing the
//! linear one.
