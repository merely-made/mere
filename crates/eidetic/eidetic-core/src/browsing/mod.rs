//! Layer 4 — browsing memory, the domain the crate was named for.
//!
//! A [`BrowsingTrace`] is a chronological segment of one owner's (persona's)
//! traversals, stored as a typed payload (design pass §6.2). Traces are the
//! durable, portable impression of browsing — deliberately coarser than
//! `node-lineage`'s live per-owner branch detail, which remains the
//! graph-shaped working memory this module projects *from* (see
//! [`lineage`], feature `"lineage"`) rather than duplicates.
//!
//! [`BrowsingMemory`] composes traces into the user-facing reads: the recent
//! corridor, time-window slices, and traversal co-occurrence. Everything
//! saves **LocalOnly** — promotion to a wider audience is always a separate,
//! explicit act (design pass §8), never a side effect of remembering.
//!
//! [`frecency`] folds the same corpus into the behavioural ranking — visit
//! weight by transition kind under a half-life — which recall fuses beside its
//! lexical and vector lanes (wiring plan W6b). [`page`] folds it the other
//! way: a page table keyed by a content fingerprint, so one visited page is
//! one record and N events however many URLs reached it (W6d).
//!
//! Quota is a Layer-4 policy: [`BrowsingMemory::apply_quota`] keeps the N
//! most recent *stored* traces and deletes older manifests (blob bytes await
//! the explicit GC pass, per the manifest-deletion doctrine).
