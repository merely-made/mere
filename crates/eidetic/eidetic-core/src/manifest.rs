//! Layer 2 — typed metadata about blobs.
//!
//! A [`BlobManifest`] describes a blob without reading it. It carries content
//! hash, size, schema reference, source list, timestamps, and the three-axis
//! classification (privacy / provenance / trust). Manifests are themselves
//! serialized (as JSON) to the Layer 1 [`Store`](crate::Store) under a known
//! prefix; the blob layer doesn't know they're manifests.
//!
//! ## Sources and the [`BlobFetcher`] split
//!
//! A manifest carries a *list* of sources where its blob can be obtained.
//! [`resolve_blob`] walks them in order:
//!
//! - [`BlobSource::Embedded`] — bytes are inline; return them directly.
//! - [`BlobSource::Local`] — bytes live in the [`Store`](crate::Store);
//!   `resolve_blob` loads them.
//! - Anything else (`Iroh`, `Https`, `LocalFile`, `LocalOnlyRef`) — eidetic
//!   delegates to a [`BlobFetcher`]. Concrete fetchers (an iroh-blobs
//!   fetcher, an HTTP fetcher) live in companion crates so eidetic stays
//!   wasm-friendly and dependency-light.
//!
//! Hash verification (BLAKE3) runs on every successful fetch before the
//! bytes are returned or cached.
