//! The three memory levels' read-model: classifying a node as short-term or
//! long-term, and computing which short-term nodes an eviction policy would drop.
//!
//! This is the spine of Alembic slice C (the memory model). It is pure logic over
//! a graph's persisted nodes plus per-node last-visit timing the host supplies, so
//! it is fully testable without a live graph, store, or clock. The host wiring (the
//! Alembic Recent / Saved sections rendering over this, the policy as a setting, the
//! actual eviction pass) layers on top once it lands.
//!
//! The model (Alembic plan, decision #2, confirmed with Mark): **a tag or a pin
//! promotes a node to long-term**, retained and never evicted. Everything else is
//! short-term working memory, subject to the eviction policy. Codicils (slice A) are
//! the third level and are not nodes, so they are out of scope here.
