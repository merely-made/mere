//! Mere's composed graph surface.
//!
//! Applications depend on this crate for graph truth and its portable
//! projections. It deliberately does not expose browser-window, input, render,
//! or session-host concerns; those belong to a consumer such as Turnstone.
//!
//! Capability features keep that facade honest:
//!
//! - `graph`: portable graph and domain vocabulary;
//! - `linked-data`: semantic import/export;
//! - `canvas`: Mere's graph-aware visual surface;
//! - `workbench`: app-host composition and routing.

/// Mere's routing vocabulary over inker's host-neutral policy: the
/// app-flavored host-handled ids + [`routing::route_policy`].
