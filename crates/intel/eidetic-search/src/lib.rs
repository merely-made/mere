//! eidetic-search — lexical recall over your own trail (Phase 9, producer half).
//!
//! The [`TrailIndex`] is a tantivy index minted **from** `BrowsingTrace`
//! codicils: derived state, never the source of truth. The trace corpus in
//! the eidetic store is the authority; the index can always be re-minted
//! from it ([`TrailIndex::rebuild`]), which is exactly what happens when the
//! on-disk index's format no longer matches the linked tantivy
//! ([`SearchError::FormatMismatch`] — tantivy does not promise index
//! compatibility across releases, so the format version travels with the
//! index and recipients reject-or-re-mint, the workspace-pins doctrine
//! applied to a wire format).
//!
//! Three surfaces:
//!
//! - **Recall** — [`TrailIndex::search`]: BM25 over tokenized titles, page
//!   text, and URL components; a single absolute URL takes an exact canonical
//!   URL path. "Where did I read about X?"
//! - **Reports** — [`TrailIndex::top_domains`] /
//!   [`TrailIndex::visits_histogram`] over the reserved fast-field columns
//!   (domain / owner / time / transition are columnar from day one, so
//!   reports need no re-index).
//! - **Fusion** — [`fuse`] / [`fuse_many`]: the engine-agnostic seam that
//!   merges this crate's lexical ranking with a vector ranking (`intel/embed`
//!   or any other) and any further lane — the behavioural one in
//!   `eidetic::browsing::frecency` — by reciprocal-rank fusion. This crate
//!   deliberately does not depend on an embedding engine; the caller brings
//!   the rankings.
//!
//! The `SearchIndexSpec` codicil ([`spec`]) is the hand-off contract: it
//! names the field set, tokenizer, and tantivy format version. Locally it
//! also rides a sidecar file in the index directory so `open` can check
//! compatibility before tantivy touches the segments; as an codicil it is
//! what a moot's consume half (deferred) would verify before merging.
