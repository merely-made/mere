//! Which adapter the wgpu runtime *would* bind, asked without binding it.
//!
//! [`DecoderDevice::wgpu`](super::DecoderDevice::wgpu) is infallible by
//! construction: it names a [`DecoderGpuKind`] and the adapter is not resolved
//! until the first kernel launches, inside cubecl, where the failure mode is a
//! panic. And the panic is not the dangerous part. cubecl's
//! `select_from_adapter_list` partitions the enumerated adapters into "matches
//! the requested device type" and "reports `DeviceType::Other`", and when the
//! requested list is too short it **falls through to the `Other` list** at the
//! same index, panicking only when that is short too. A host that asked for a
//! discrete GPU can therefore be handed something else and never be told.
//!
//! So a host that means to advertise a GPU has to know *which* adapter it got,
//! before it advertises anything. This module answers that question by
//! mirroring cubecl's selection — the same graphics backend, the same
//! `enumerate_adapters`, the same device-type filter, the same index, the same
//! `CUBECL_WGPU_DEFAULT_DEVICE` rule — and reporting the adapter's own
//! `wgpu::AdapterInfo` as plain data. It creates an instance and enumerates; it
//! never requests a device or a queue, so nothing here binds the GPU.
//!
//! It is a *mirror*, which means it can drift. The mirrored code is
//! `cubecl-wgpu`'s `runtime.rs` (`request_adapter`, `select_from_adapter_list`,
//! `get_device_override`) and `graphics.rs` (`AutoGraphicsApi`), read at
//! cubecl-wgpu 0.11.0-pre.2. A caller that composes on the strength of this
//! answer is asserting the mirror is current; a receipt that runs real work on
//! the reported adapter is what keeps that assertion honest.
//!
//! ## The `CUBECL_WGPU_DEFAULT_DEVICE` rule, copied rather than invented
//!
//! cubecl consults that variable **only** when the requested device is
//! `DefaultDevice`/`BestAvailable`. An explicit `DiscreteGpu(0)` ignores it
//! outright. This module does the same, so the answer stays an answer about
//! what cubecl would do. A value the variable carries that cubecl cannot parse
//! is refused by name instead of being silently dropped: cubecl logs and
//! ignores it, and an owner who set it deserves better than a log line nobody
//! reads.
