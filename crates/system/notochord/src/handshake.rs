//! The bounded session handshake (plan V6, decision D6).
//!
//! Sans-io on purpose: this module turns bytes into decisions and decisions
//! into bytes, and never touches a socket. The transport adapter above it
//! reads one length-bounded frame, calls [`respond`], writes the reply, and
//! only then hands the stream to the application. Keeping it io-free is what
//! lets the whole admission matrix run as ordinary unit tests, and what keeps
//! this crate free of the QUIC and mesh dependencies its callers carry.
//!
//! ## What the signature covers
//!
//! The initiator signs a canonical transcript with a personae-derived key,
//! attested to its master identity. The transcript binds every field of the
//! hello *and* the facts both peers can independently derive
//! ([`ProofBinding`]): the protocol, the initiator's carrier-proved identity
//! if there is one, and the shared link if the carrier has link identity. The
//! responder rebuilds the transcript from what it observed itself, so a proof
//! minted for one connection does not verify on another. That is what makes a
//! captured hello useless when replayed over a different link.
