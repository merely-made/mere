//! Async framing for the handshake, behind the `tokio` feature.
//!
//! The decision logic in [`crate::handshake`] is sans-io and stays that way;
//! this is the small amount of socket work every caller would otherwise
//! duplicate. One `u32` big-endian length prefix, bounded before a single
//! payload byte is read, then the sans-io path.
//!
//! Both halves are deliberately shaped so the application stream is only
//! reachable after a decision: [`accept_session`] hands back the decision, and
//! the caller keeps or drops the stream accordingly.
