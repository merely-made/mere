//! Portable shell session state for the Mere browser.
//!
//! This crate owns the host-neutral session-state types that the runtime
//! surfaces on `GraphshellRuntime` and the `Frame*` view-models: focus
//! authorities, command palette state, omnibar/toolbar drafts, frame
//! view-models, return-target routing, and UX diagnostics/observability/probes.
//!
//! Each module is WASM-clean (no egui, no servo, no tokio, no platform I/O)
//! and testable without booting a host. Consumers (host-contract,
//! graphshell-side reducers, future host adapters) reach for these types
//! when they need to project, restore, or mutate session state.
//!
//! The vocabulary primitives (`geometry`, `time`, `pane`, `content`, etc.)
//! and the host-port trait definitions live in
//! [`kernel`](https://crates.io/crates/kernel); this crate
//! depends on those.
