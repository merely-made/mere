//! # luggage
//!
//! Self-update for apps packaged by
//! [`cargo-packager`](https://docs.rs/cargo-packager): check a `Feed` for a
//! signed release manifest, download and verify (BLAKE3 when the manifest
//! carries it, then minisign always), and install per platform.
//!
//! Forked from `cargo-packager-updater` 0.2.3; see the crate README for the
//! provenance and the recorded divergences.
//!
//! Start at `check_update` (the `native` feature), which carries the worked
//! example.
//!
//! ## The `native` feature
//!
//! On by default, and it carries the entire update pipeline: checking feeds,
//! downloading, staging, installing — everything that touches the network,
//! the filesystem, or the host process.
//!
//! With `default-features = false` what remains is the **release-identity
//! core**: [`ReleaseRefV1`] — a reference naming one signed release — plus
//! [`RemoteRelease`], [`ReleaseManifestPlatform`], [`UpdateFormat`] and
//! [`MANIFEST_NAME`], which are what a release *is* and how it is spelled in
//! a manifest. No I/O, no feed configuration, and no dependency that fails to
//! build for `wasm32`.
//!
//! Verification is deliberately *not* part of that surface. The minisign and
//! BLAKE3 checks are `pub(crate)` helpers driven by the native pipeline, so
//! they went with it. A core consumer can name and compare a release;
//! verifying one would need an entry point this crate does not yet export,
//! and adding one is a public-API decision rather than a mechanical split.
//!
//! That split exists so a browser can *name and verify* a release without
//! carrying an updater it could never run. The alternative was a second,
//! parallel release type maintained by hand on the browser side, which is the
//! kind of duplicate that drifts silently and is wrong exactly when it
//! matters. Release identity has one definition, and this is it.
//!
//! ## Feeds
//!
//! - **HTTP(S)** — upstream semantics: the endpoint may contain
//!   `{{target}}`, `{{arch}}` and `{{current_version}}`, and answers 204 (no
//!   update) or 200 with the release JSON.
//! - **Directory** — a local path holding `luggage.json`; artifact URLs are
//!   `file://`. No server: a LAN share or a mounted drive is a feed.
//! - **GitHub** — `github:owner/repo`; the latest release's `luggage.json`
//!   asset is the manifest and its other assets are the artifacts.
//!
//! ## Manifest
//!
//! The JSON shape upstream documents (`version`, `platforms.<target>.url` /
//! `signature` / `format`, optional `notes` / `pub_date`), plus an optional
//! per-platform `blake3` hex digest verified before the signature.
//!
//! **The manifest itself is signed too**, as a detached `luggage.json.sig`
//! served beside it, and is verified before anything in it is believed. A
//! per-artifact signature cannot cover the version and URL announced around
//! it, so without this a feed can advertise an old signed build as a new
//! version and roll a client backwards. See
//! `Config::require_signed_manifest` (the `native` feature), which defaults
//! to `true`.
//!
//! ## Staging
//!
//! `Update::stage` writes a verified artifact into an app-owned directory so
//! "ready to restart" survives the app closing, and
//! `StagedUpdate::take_verified` re-checks its digest at apply time. Both are
//! part of the `native` feature.
