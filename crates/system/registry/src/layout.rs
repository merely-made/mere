//! Layout-domain registry — canvas, workbench-surface, and
//! profile-registry primitives, plus the conformance vocabulary
//! (`ConformanceLevel`, `CapabilityDeclaration`,
//! `SurfaceSubsystemCapabilities`) that surface profiles use to
//! declare per-subsystem guarantees.
//!
//! Extracted from `registries/domain/layout/` per Slice 55. The
//! `viewer_surface.rs` sub-module of the original directory stayed
//! in tree because it depends on `crate::layout::registries::atomic::viewer`
//! (the viewer registry hasn't been extracted yet — `util::VersoAddress`
//! promotion is the prerequisite). Once viewer extracts, viewer_surface
//! folds in here.
//!
//! The aggregator `LayoutDomainRegistry` (which composed canvas +
//! workbench_surface + viewer_surface registries together) also stayed
//! in tree for the same reason — it can't compose what isn't here yet.
//! This crate exposes the registry primitives; the aggregator is a
//! shell-side composition concern until viewer lands.
