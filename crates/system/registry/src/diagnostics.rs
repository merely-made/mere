//! Diagnostics registry — channel name catalog + descriptor literals
//! + `DiagnosticsRegistry` in one crate.
//!
//! This crate is the keystone extraction for the registrar sweep
//! (Slice 53 of the workspace architecture proposal). The 253
//! channel-name `&'static str` constants and the descriptor
//! literals that key on them are the load-bearing tangle that
//! blocks 8+ other registry extractions (`mod-loader`, `action`,
//! `agent`, `identity`, `input`, `theme`, `workflow`,
//! `workbench-surface`). With both halves in this crate, those
//! registries can each `use registry::diagnostics::channels::*`
//! and the relevant descriptor types directly without going
//! through the shell-side runtime mod.
