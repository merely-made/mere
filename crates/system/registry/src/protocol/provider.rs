//! Mod-based protocol-handler provider hook. Mods implement
//! [`ProtocolHandlerProvider`] to register their handlers into a
//! [`ProtocolContractRegistry`](super::contract::ProtocolContractRegistry)
//! during activation; the host collects provider closures into a
//! [`ProtocolHandlerProviders`] bundle and applies them all at runtime
//! startup.
//!
//! Folded into the same crate as the contract registry (Slice 51)
//! because providers register *into* the registry — they belong in the
//! same crate even though the file split is preserved for navigation.
