//! Portable emit scaffold for the registrar layer.
//!
//! Slice 59 ("Option A" per the diagnostics-emit DI design choice).
//! Registries extracted as their own crates need a way to emit
//! diagnostic events without depending on the shell-side runtime.
//! This module provides:
//!
//! - [`DiagnosticEvent`] — the *portable subset* of the diagnostic
//!   event taxonomy (Span + Message variants). Rich shell-side
//!   variants (CompositorFrame, IntentBatch) carry shell-only
//!   payload types and stay in tree.
//! - [`SpanPhase`], [`StructuredPayloadField`] — the value types
//!   the portable variants reference.
//! - [`install_global_sender`] / [`emit_event`] — the same
//!   thread_local-aware global sender pattern that ran in the
//!   shell-side runtime, lifted here so registry crates can
//!   `use register_diagnostics::emit_event` directly.
//!
//! ## Bridging to the shell-side runtime
//!
//! The shell-side runtime maintains its own richer DiagnosticEvent +
//! ring buffer for events it cares about (CompositorFrame batches,
//! IntentBatch records). Bridging is straightforward: at startup the
//! shell-side calls [`install_global_sender`] with a Sender whose
//! receiver translates each `register_diagnostics::DiagnosticEvent`
//! into the shell-side's own variant (mapping is field-for-field
//! since the variant shapes match). This bridging lands per-registry
//! as register-mod-loader, register-identity, etc. extract and start
//! emitting through this scaffold.
