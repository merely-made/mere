//! Accessibility host for a genet-backed Cambium app.
//!
//! Split out of `cambium-winit` on 2026-07-26, code unchanged. It lives apart
//! for one reason: it needs the laid-out genet DOM and the platform adapter,
//! which cannot be published, and holding them here leaves `cambium-winit` with
//! only `cambium` and `winit` so its key translation is reachable from a
//! registry consumer. A host that wants both takes both crates.
//!
//! Every Cambium app emits a semantic, ARIA-attributed DOM laid out by
//! Livery/Buckram, and paints its custom visuals with Sprigging leaves. This
//! module turns that into a live accessibility tree for the OS screen reader,
//! so no app has to hand-roll the wiring:
//!
//! - [`A11yHost`] owns the platform adapter and the per-frame lifecycle: project
//!   the retained layout into an AccessKit tree (leaf semantics included),
//!   install it the first frame and update it after, and drain a screen reader's
//!   actions, handing back the DOM nodes to activate so the app routes them
//!   through the same click path a mouse uses.
//!
//! The app keeps only what is app-specific: create the window hidden (the
//! adapter must attach before it is shown), drive the first frame synchronously
//! (a hidden window may not receive a deferred redraw), turn the wake callback
//! into a redraw, and dispatch the returned nodes.
