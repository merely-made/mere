//! The stock a Cambium application host is grafted onto.
//!
//! A rootstock is the body a scion is fitted to: one root system, and tops that
//! can be exchanged without regrowing it. That is the relation here. The winit
//! event source is one scion, a browser's DOM will be another, and the living
//! machinery they are both fitted to does not change between them.
//!
//! `cambium-genet-winit-host` grew as one crate because there was one event
//! source. A browser is a second one, and the machinery it would need is the
//! same machinery: retained layout over the runner's DOM, logical-coordinate
//! hit testing, input routing, focus and spatial navigation, frame pacing, and
//! accessibility projection. None of that is about winit; the winit host
//! carries only 64 winit references across 3544 lines.
//!
//! This crate is that machinery's new home. It owns no event loop, no window,
//! and no surface. An event-source adapter (winit today, DOM next) converts
//! platform events into the vocabulary here and drives it.
//!
//! ## What lives here first
//!
//! The input vocabulary, because it is the seam every other piece crosses. The
//! winit host's [`KeyPress`] already existed for a version of this reason: a
//! `winit::event::KeyEvent` cannot be constructed outside winit, so a host that
//! routed one could never be driven from a test. A host that routes one also
//! cannot be driven from a browser. Same defect, wider blast radius.

// The types an event source implements the seams against, re-exported so a
// source names this crate rather than four.
