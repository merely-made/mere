//! Pointer, keyboard, IME, and wheel routing. Extracted from the
//! woodshed-genet donor, then completed against Cambium's full native event
//! vocabulary (drag capture, wheel handlers, routed Tab).
//!
//! The routing rule everywhere below is the browser's: **the view layer sees
//! the event first, the host default runs second, and a handler that calls
//! `prevent_default` cancels the host default**. That is why Tab goes through
//! [`dispatch_key`](cambium::GenetAppRunner::dispatch_key) rather than straight
//! to `focus_traverse`, and why click-to-caret and wheel scrolling are gated on
//! [`default_prevented`](cambium::GenetAppRunner::default_prevented).
