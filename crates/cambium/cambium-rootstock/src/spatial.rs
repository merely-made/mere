//! Spatial focus navigation: hold Tab, then steer with the arrow keys.
//!
//! Tab traversal walks *document order*, which is the wrong shape for anything
//! laid out in two dimensions. Woodshed's fretboard puts sixty focusable notes
//! between you and the search field; a six-by-six grid of buttons takes
//! thirty-five presses to cross diagonally. Document order is a list, and a list
//! is a bad map.
//!
//! So: **hold Tab and the arrow keys move focus to the nearest control in that
//! direction.** Tap Tab and nothing changes — it traverses exactly as before.
//! The mode is entered by the key-repeat that holding produces, so the OS's own
//! repeat delay is the "held" threshold and no timer is needed.
//!
//! This belongs to the host and nowhere else. It needs the focusable set, which
//! only the runner knows, and the laid-out geometry, which only the layout
//! knows. No application has both, and the view layer has no layout at all.
