//! The accessibility seam: what a screen reader is told, what happens when it
//! acts, and that it can wake an idle application at all.
//!
//! The OS adapter is the one piece a test cannot supply, so it is the one piece
//! not asserted here. Everything on either side of it is: the projection the
//! adapter is handed, the mapping from a raw AccessKit request to a typed one,
//! the routing of that request into the retained DOM, and the wake callback the
//! adapter is given.
