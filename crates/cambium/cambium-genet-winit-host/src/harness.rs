//! [`Harness`]: the host with no window and no GPU.
//!
//! Every receipt this host owes — "a click on the element labelled *Install*
//! advances the page", "Tab reaches the controls in this order", "a screen
//! reader's Focus request does not activate the control" — is about routing,
//! not about pixels. Routing needs a real retained DOM and a real laid-out
//! tree, and needs neither a window nor a swapchain.
//!
//! So the harness is the same [`Host`], constructed with `window: None`, driven
//! through the same `click` / `key` / `wheel` / `relayout` methods the winit
//! event loop calls. A test that passes here exercised production routing; it
//! did not re-implement it. That is deliberately the opposite of the usual
//! "mock the host" arrangement, where the tested path is the one nobody ships.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let mut h = Harness::new(sheet, state, logic);
//! h.layout_at(800.0, 600.0);
//! assert!(h.click_on(&Selector::role("button").containing("Install")));
//! assert_eq!(h.state().stage, Stage::Install);
//! ```
//!
//! Applications get it too: it is how `signalman-desktop` proves its page
//! states and its keyboard order without a display.
