//! The single-root Cambium desktop host.
//!
//! Every Cambium desktop application so far has hand-assembled the same
//! machinery: a winit `ApplicationHandler` owning one window, a genet
//! [`SurfaceHost`] presenting a `netrender` scene, a retained
//! owned Livery/Buckram layout over the runner's `ScriptedDom`, logical-coordinate
//! hit testing, pointer/keyboard/IME/wheel routing into a
//! [`cambium::GenetAppRunner`], overlay-scrollbar fade policy, and the
//! [`A11yHost`] install-before-show lifecycle. This crate is that machinery,
//! extracted once, from the woodshed-genet donor.
//!
//! Deliberately **not** here, per the Signalman desktop scope (retinue,
//! 2026-08-09): no async runtime, no application trait, no multi-window,
//! docking, navigation, persistence, or command system. The application
//! supplies plain closures ([`HostHooks`]) and keeps its own state in their
//! environment; the host owns lifecycle, layout, paint, input routing, and
//! accessibility synchronization, and nothing above them.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let options = HostOptions { title: "App".into(), ..Default::default() };
//! run(options, |window, commands, wake| Init { state, logic, sheet }, hooks)
//! ```
