//! Scenotime: the runtime vocabulary for a scene through time.
//!
//! A one-shot [`sceno::Scene`] is dense. Scenotime turns it into an epoch-scoped
//! slot table whose indexes are never reused, applies revision-based diffs
//! transactionally, and preserves tombstones in resynchronization snapshots.
//! Networking, presentation resources, and product authority remain outside.
