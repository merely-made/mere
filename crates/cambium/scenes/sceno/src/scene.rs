//! The projection scene — the output side of the contract.
//!
//! Identity is an index (the data-oriented doctrine): sources, spaces,
//! backdrops, items, relations, and regions are dense vectors; ids are indexes into
//! them. The source/instance separation is structural: one [`SourceRef`]
//! entry may be pointed at by many [`ProjectedItem`]s, which is how one
//! phrase appears in the loop table, the history branch, and the similarity
//! map without duplicating truth.
//!
//! The representation measures content; the projection places it. A scene
//! carries a representation *slot* and an assigned extent per item, never
//! rendered content.
