//! Sprigging supplies retained custom-paint leaves for GUI hosts.
//!
//! A small, sharp contract that lets an imperative custom-paint widget (a knob,
//! meter, waveform, graph canvas) live as one first-class Genet element,
//! plugging into Genet's four existing passes rather than standing up a second
//! UI engine. Design and rationale:
//! `design_docs/cambium_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-07-07_chisel_widget_leaf_design.md`.
//!
//! This is the Path-A scaffold: a leaf paints by pushing common `PaintCmd`s
//! (portable, tile-cached) which Genet splices into its paint list at the
//! leaf's box. Path B (a leaf renders its own `vello::Scene` which the host
//! rasterizes to a texture and places via `DrawExternalTexture`) lands with the
//! first imperative consumer (the meerkat orrery port).
//!
//! Sprigging is engine-neutral: it targets the paint seam (`paint_list_api`) and
//! accesskit, not the Genet engine concretely. The retained per-leaf state
//! lives in a node-keyed [`LeafRegistry`], mirroring Genet's external-texture /
//! font / image registries, so the DOM stays uniform.
