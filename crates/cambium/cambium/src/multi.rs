//! [`GenetMultiRunner`]: one app state, N windows, each a projection
//! (one-state-N-windows design, step 2).
//!
//! One runner owns one `State`. Each **projection** is a
//! [`RunnerTree`](crate::runner) — its own `ScriptedDom` target, retained view
//! tree, focus, and pointer capture — plus its own view-producing logic (a lens
//! over the shared state). One [`update`](GenetMultiRunner::update) mutates
//! the state once and rebuilds every projection; a dispatch into any window
//! routes through that window's tree, then rebuilds every projection, so a
//! click in window A updates what window B shows in the same pass. Multi-window
//! synced panels stop being a sync feature: there is one state, so there is
//! nothing to synchronize.
//!
//! Projections rebuild in **insertion order**, which is therefore the parking
//! order for portable children: a `PortableKeyed` departure preserves across a
//! move only when its source projection rebuilds before the target
//! (`portable.rs`'s ordering caveat). Hosts arrange tear-out source windows
//! before targets, or accept the safe fresh-build degradation.
//!
//! Two topologies, one runner API:
//!
//! - [`push_projection`](GenetMultiRunner::push_projection) — **N doms**: each
//!   projection owns a distinct `ScriptedDom`, building under its document root.
//!   Per-tree nursery draining confines parked elements to their own dom, so a
//!   cross-**window** `PortableKeyed` move degrades to fresh-build (correct, no
//!   leak; the tile's DOM node/scroll/focus do not survive).
//! - [`push_forest_projection`](GenetMultiRunner::push_forest_projection) —
//!   the **forest dom** (design step 3): every projection shares ONE document
//!   and builds under its own **window-root** element (a runner tree that
//!   mounts at a node, not the document root. The retired `ForestDom` spike
//!   proved the shape; Pelt's host-reconstruction lane must supply the owned
//!   Livery/Buckram subtree layout seam. Because the
//!   windows are subtrees of one document, a cross-window `move_before` is
//!   intra-document, so a torn-out tile keeps its DOM node, scroll, focus, and
//!   animation. This is the substrate that spike de-risked.
