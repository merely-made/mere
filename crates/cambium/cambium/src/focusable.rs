//! The [`focusable`] marker view: make an element focusable on its own, with no
//! key handler attached.
//!
//! Focusability is otherwise *implied* by an [`on_key`](crate::on_key) handler (a
//! node is focusable because it is in the key registry). That leaves a plain
//! control — a [`button`](crate::button) or [`checkbox`](crate::checkbox), which
//! carry only an [`on_click`](crate::on_click) — keyboard-unreachable: it cannot be
//! Tab-focused and a screen-reader / keyboard user cannot activate it. Wrapping it
//! in [`focusable`] registers the node in [`GenetCtx`]'s explicit focusable set
//! (the keyboard-model escape hatch, grab-bag G2.3), so it joins the Tab order and
//! the runner activates it on Enter/Space by synthesizing a click (the keyboard
//! equivalent of a pointer click — see
//! [`dispatch_key`](crate::GenetAppRunner::dispatch_key)).
//!
//! The view is a transparent wrapper, structured like [`OnKey`](crate::OnKey) minus
//! the handler: it pushes its own [`ON_FOCUSABLE_ID`] so its routing position is
//! well-formed, registers/unregisters the focusable mark on build/teardown,
//! re-keys it on a node swap, and forwards every routed message to its child (it
//! never terminates a path — it owns no handler). It passes the child's element
//! through, so it is itself an [`ElementView`] and composes:
//! `focusable(button(..))` is a keyboard-operable button.
