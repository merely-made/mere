//! The Genet-native runner that owns app state and the retained view tree.
//!
//! Meristem provides view diffing and message routing but does not schedule
//! work. [`GenetAppRunner`] owns state, the root node, and the rebuild cadence
//! that turns a state change into DOM mutations.
//!
//! [`GenetAppRunner`] is that owner, kept deliberately thin: it depends only
//! on `meristem` and this backend, never on Livery/Buckram or presentation. A host
//! crate such as `pelt-desktop` drives the render side over the
//! [`ScriptedDom`](genet_scripted_dom::ScriptedDom) the runner mutates.
//!
//! Native event dispatch takes a hit [`NodeId`] (the `point → NodeId` half is
//! the host's responsibility), walks the node's ancestor chain, and routes
//! events through Meristem's message cycle. The timer tick that drives
//! [`update`](GenetAppRunner::update), platform input, relayout, rendering, and
//! presentation remain host concerns.
//!
//! **One state, N windows** (one-state-N-windows design, step 2): the per-tree
//! half of the runner — the dom, ctx, retained view, focus, and pointer
//! capture — lives in the crate-internal [`RunnerTree`], with app state and
//! the view-producing logic threaded in per call. [`GenetAppRunner`] is one
//! state + one tree (this file, public API unchanged);
//! [`GenetMultiRunner`](crate::GenetMultiRunner) is one state + N trees,
//! each a projection of the same state into its own `ScriptedDom`.
