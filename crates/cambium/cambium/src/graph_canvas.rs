//! A bounded, interactive viewport over Sprigging's shared graph canvas.
//!
//! The graph remains one paint leaf. Each node also gets a small, absolutely
//! positioned native button in the view layer, projected through the same
//! [`GraphViewport`] as the leaf. Paint, hit targets, keyboard focus, and hover
//! therefore stay aligned without teaching a paint leaf about app actions.
