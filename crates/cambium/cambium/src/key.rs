//! The native key event view: [`on_key`]`(child, handler)`, plus the
//! Genet-native [`KeyEvent`] it carries.
//!
//! It mirrors [`OnClick`](crate::OnClick), swapping the click payload for a
//! [`KeyEvent`] and the click registry for the parallel key registry on
//! [`GenetCtx`]. This layer stays platform-neutral; `cambium-winit` provides
//! winit translation.
//!
//! As with [`on_click`](crate::on_click): there is no browser, so no
//! `addEventListener`. On build, the view records its routing path in
//! [`GenetCtx`]'s *key* registry, keyed by the DOM node it wraps. The runner
//! ([`dispatch_key`]) is the dispatch engine: it routes a [`KeyEvent`] from the
//! currently *focused* node up its ancestor chain through the same
//! `id_path`-routed `View::message` cycle the click path uses. Key handlers and
//! explicit [`focusable`](crate::focusable) markers define the focus set;
//! [`dispatch_click`] focuses the nearest eligible ancestor of the click target.
//!
//! The message-routing shape is identical to [`OnClick::message`]: the captured
//! `view_path()` ends in [`ON_KEY_ID`], so `message` does `take_first()` (==
//! [`ON_KEY_ID`]), then — if the remaining path is empty — `take_message`s the
//! [`KeyEvent`] and calls the handler; otherwise it forwards to the child.
//!
//! [`dispatch_key`]: crate::GenetAppRunner::dispatch_key
