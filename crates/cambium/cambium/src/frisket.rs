//! Frisket: a pane frame — splits and tab-stacks — as one composition.
//!
//! On a hand press the *frisket* is the hinged frame whose cut-out apertures
//! decide what prints where; this is the same frame, over a window. The name
//! comes from turnstone's crate, which this module retires: the family had spelled
//! "a tree of resizable panes" four times (this view trapped in `ports/pelt`, a
//! second tree in turnstone, the reusable `workbench` contract, the furniture here),
//! and they resolve to one implementation. Direction:
//! `genet:docs/2026-07-24_frisket_pane_component_direction.md`.
//!
//! **The tree is the caller's state**, like the split's ratio and the strip's
//! selection: [`frisket`] renders whatever tree the caller hands it and reports
//! gestures as [`TileEvent`]s for the caller to apply through
//! [`TileTree::apply`]. The component never mutates the tree, so one host can
//! hold a plain tree while another projects one from richer truth (mere's platen
//! projects a forme arrangement onto it) and both drive the same view.
//!
//! **No layout dependency, by design.** The parts here are the view and the DOM
//! *semantics*: which element is a divider, which is a tab, which tab bar
//! belongs to which stack. A host lays the DOM out and hit-tests it, then asks
//! [`divider_target`] / [`tab_target`] / [`stack_target`] what it hit. That
//! keeps the walking logic in one place — it was duplicated per host before —
//! while layout stays where the host's engine is. The one gesture that needs
//! real geometry, resolving a tab drop to an insertion index, takes the rects
//! through a closure ([`tab_drop_index`]).
//!
//! Content is a [`Slot`]. [`frisket`] draws a placeholder marked with the
//! active tile's id and nothing else, and the host composites a document scene,
//! an external texture, or its own surface into that rect. [`frisket_with`]
//! widens that to three: the same hole, a surface the host names as one, or a
//! child view the frame nests. So a browser pane, a practice-set pane, a
//! tactical map pane and a pane made of ordinary views are the same frame.
//!
//! A [`Slot::View`] child is rendered through a
//! [`PortableKeyed`](crate::PortableKeyed) keyed by [`TileId`], so dragging a
//! tile into another stack *moves* its element rather than rebuilding it: the
//! child keeps its DOM node, its view state and its handlers.
//!
//! The tab bar is [`tab_bar_view`](crate::tab_bar_view), the crate's one tab
//! bar, wearing Frisket's `frisket-*` names on top of the shared `tablist` /
//! `tab` / `tab-close` vocabulary so a product stylesheet written against
//! either keeps matching.
