//! The view context for the Genet backend.
//!
//! It holds the `id_path` used for message routing, a shared handle to the
//! [`ScriptedDom`] every view mutates, event-handler registries, focusability
//! markers, and the portable-child nursery.
//!
//! Each click or key handler has a propagation phase ([`Handler::capture`]): a
//! listener registered with `capture == true` fires in
//! the `root → target` capture pass, one with `capture == false` (the
//! browser/`xilem_web` default) in the `target → root` bubble pass. A node may
//! carry *several* listeners of one kind (nested `on_click`s over one element, a
//! handler beside an instrumentation listener), so each registry maps a node to a
//! `Vec` of [`Handler`]s and dispatch routes every one — in registration order
//! within the matching phase — rather than letting a later listener silently
//! clobber an earlier one.
