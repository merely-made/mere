//! Reusable split-and-tab workspace organization for Genet hosts.
//!
//! A [`TileTree`] is a tree of **splits** (a row/column of children, each with a
//! fractional share) and **tab-stacks** (a set of tiles, one active). The surface lib
//! renders a tree and emits [`TileEvent`]s (activate / close / drag / divider move);
//! the host owns the authoritative tree, applies the events, and feeds back the next
//! tree. A host can use the raw [`TileTree`] reducer, or retain one in [`Workbench`]
//! to receive typed host effects such as a tearout request. Pelt populates it from its
//! own simple state; Mere projects Forme onto it through Platen's tree projection — a
//! *projection*, not a second authority.
//!
//! **Presentation vocabulary only.** This contract names splits, tabs, fractions, and
//! the two content lanes — nothing about graphs, sessions, lineage, or arrangement
//! relations. If it ever starts wanting those, it is drifting toward forme (the
//! arrangement truth on the mere side) and should stop. forme maps *onto* this; this
//! never grows toward forme.

/// A host-assigned identity for a tile, stable across the renders of one running
/// surface. Opaque to the contract (the host mints + interprets it).
