//! The generic scenario lane for a Cambium document host.
//!
//! One product's acceptance run grew the whole shape first: a
//! [`taproot::Scenario`] ticked once per *presented* frame inside
//! `after_frame`, a deferred window close that lets the last requested readback
//! land, capture arming through the host's own `read_frame`, PNG writing,
//! viewport-masked pixel comparison, bounded CPU cost accounting, and one JSON
//! receipt carrying captures, digests, snapshot fields, checkpoints, errors and
//! misses. None of that was about that product. This crate is that lane with
//! the product cut out of it.
//!
//! What stays the product's is everything that reads its own state: the typed
//! [`ProbeSnapshot`], its event stream, its `act` labels, which DOM element is
//! the viewport, where its default output directory is, and any verb its own
//! grammar adds. That is the [`Product`] trait — a small set of hooks a
//! consumer implements once, after which [`Lane`] runs the lifecycle.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let mut lane = Lane::new(MyProduct, scenario, receipt, capture, exit_code)
//!     .with_frame_limit(Some(1800));
//! // in HostHooks::after_frame
//! lane.after_frame(ctx);
//! // in HostHooks::close_request
//! lane.request_close();
//! ```
