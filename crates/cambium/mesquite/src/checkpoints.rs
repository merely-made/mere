//! What `remember` took, and the four verbs that read it back.
//!
//! A checkpoint is one snapshot's fields under a name. The lane owns them; a
//! [`Product`](crate::Product) is handed this read-only view alongside the
//! scenario line, so a product verb can compare against the same checkpoints
//! the shared verbs use instead of keeping a second set of its own.
