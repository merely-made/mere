# Cambium

Cambium is a Genet-native reactive GUI toolkit. It combines Meristem's
reactive view core with a Genet DOM backend and Sprigging custom leaves.

This repository was extracted from Genet's former Serval tree. Its public
backend vocabulary is now the `Genet*` family. Deprecated `Serval*` aliases
remain for source compatibility during consumer migration.

## Crates

- `meristem`: renderer-independent reactive diff and message core
- `cambium`: Genet backend, application runner, controls, and composition;
  its `nematic` feature adds reactive views over Errand's smolweb ASTs
  (formerly the `cambium-nematic` crate)
- `cambium-winit`: winit keyboard translation for Cambium applications
- `sprigging`: engine-neutral custom leaves and arrangement geometry
- `mesquite`: the scenario lane over a document host — scenario ticking,
  captures, pixel checks, cost accounting and one JSON receipt

Every crate is MPL-2.0 (see the repository `LICENSE`); Meristem, a Xilem
derivative, keeps the Xilem Authors' Apache-2.0 notice in each derived file.

[the Xilem provenance ledger](../../design_docs/cambium_docs/technical_architecture/upstream-xilem.md)
for provenance. Licenses are recorded in the repository
[LICENSES.md](../../LICENSES.md), and the claimed package names in
[the namespace-claims doc](../../design_docs/cambium_docs/technical_architecture/namespace-claims.md).
Standalone and sibling-checkout development are described in
[the local Genet development doc](../../design_docs/cambium_docs/testing/local-genet-development.md).

## Component acceptance surface

The executable component catalog covers Cambium's controls, hover routing,
editors, action list, overlay menu, virtualized grid, and Sprigging glyph
leaves. Run it with:

```sh
cargo run -p cambium --example component_catalog --all-features
```

The same assertions run in CI as an example test. See
[the component-catalog doc](../../design_docs/cambium_docs/technical_architecture/component-catalog.md)
for the coverage rule.

## License

MPL-2.0 (see the repository `LICENSE`). `meristem` retains the Xilem Authors'
Apache-2.0 notice as a derivative; see the repository
[`LICENSES.md`](../../LICENSES.md).
