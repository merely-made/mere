//! A browsing surface around chartulary's neutral Container.
//!
//! Extracted from `graph/mod.rs` per the 2026-04-30 renderer plan §6.4
//! decomposition target. The history-projection types (`NodeNavigationMemory`,
//! `NodeHistoryProjection`, etc.) remain in `graph/mod.rs` for now — they
//! are the natural next decomposition target (as `graph/history.rs`).
//!
//! Browser-runtime state (scroll/form restore, viewer override, compat
//! mode, webview lifecycle) left this struct on 2026-07-09 for the
//! host-owned `BrowserNodeState` sidecar (pandect
//! `browser_node_state`), per the mere/turnstone boundary pass plan
//! slice C: the graph library holds graph facts; what the browser
//! knows about a node rides beside the graph, keyed by node id.
