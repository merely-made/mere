//! Portable state machine for frame-bounded async requests.
//!
//! Shell-side session state often needs to track "a request is in
//! flight; when it completes, the result lands here" — the omnibar
//! provider mailbox, deferred intent resolution, clip-capture round
//! trips, etc. The pre-M4 pattern embedded `crossbeam_channel`
//! receivers inside the session state, which is fine on desktop but
//! doesn't compile to `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (crossbeam_channel
//! needs `std::thread`).
//!
//! `AsyncRequestState<T>` is the portable replacement: pure data, no
//! threading primitives inside. A host-side driver owns the actual
//! channel / future / fetch, and deposits results into this state
//! when ready. The shell-state side just reads and reacts.
//!
//! Concretely:
//!
//! - **Shell state** holds `AsyncRequestState<T>`. Calling code
//!   transitions via [`arm_pending`], [`resolve`], [`interrupt`],
//!   [`clear`]. Generation counter lets the state reject stale late
//!   results from requests that have since been superseded.
//! - **Host driver** (one per session or one per request kind) owns
//!   the concrete async machinery — `crossbeam_channel::Receiver<T>`
//!   / `tokio::sync::oneshot` / `futures::channel` / etc. Polls at
//!   frame boundaries and calls [`resolve`] / [`interrupt`] on the
//!   state it shepherds.
//!
//! The state type has no threading or time dependencies, so it is
//! safe to place inside types that belong in a portable shell-state
//! sub-crate targeting `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and `wasip2`.
//!
//! [`arm_pending`]: AsyncRequestState::arm_pending
//! [`resolve`]: AsyncRequestState::resolve
//! [`interrupt`]: AsyncRequestState::interrupt
//! [`clear`]: AsyncRequestState::clear

/// Frame-bounded state of a host-driven async request.
///
/// Generic over the result payload `T`. The enum is always fully
/// deterministic — no internal threading, no hidden waiting. Hosts
/// bridge their concrete async primitives (crossbeam / tokio /
/// futures) into this state by calling the transition methods at
/// frame boundaries.
///
/// The `generation` counter inside `Pending` and `Ready` lets callers
/// distinguish a result for the current request from a late result
/// for a request that has been superseded. The pattern:
///
/// 1. Caller initiates request, calls [`arm_pending`]; state stores
///    `generation = N`.
/// 2. Caller initiates a newer request before the first completes;
///    state moves to `generation = N + 1`, the old request's result
///    is still en route on the host driver's side.
/// 3. The old result arrives at the host driver. Driver calls
///    [`resolve`] with `generation = N`; the state is at `N + 1`, so
///    the state rejects the stale value.
/// 4. The new result arrives. Driver calls [`resolve`] with
///    `generation = N + 1`; the state accepts and transitions to
///    `Ready { generation: N + 1, value }`.
