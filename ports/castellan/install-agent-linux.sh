# Build and (re)install the personae SSH agent + vault CLI on Linux.
#
# The third of the three install ceremonies (Windows: Task Scheduler + a VBS
# relaunch loop; macOS: launchd; here: a systemd --user unit). All three end
# in the same place — an agent running at login, serving vault keys *and*
# personae certificates, with the passphrase never written to disk.
#
# Two things differ from the macOS script, both forced by the platform.
#
# 1. systemd --user replaces launchd. Restart=on-failure covers a crashed
#    child the way launchd's KeepAlive does, so no wrapper loop is needed.
#    `loginctl enable-linger` is what makes the unit survive logout, and it
#    is left to you: it is a policy decision about whether your agent should
#    outlive your session, not something an installer should assume.
#
# 2. There is no AutoOs unlock here either (Unlock::AutoOs is DPAPI, Windows
#    only). The macOS script reads the passphrase from the login Keychain;
#    the closest equivalent here is the kernel keyring or a Secret Service
#    agent, and which one exists depends on the desktop. So this installs a
#    wrapper that shells out to `secret-tool` when it is available and falls
#    back to a systemd credential file with 0600 permissions otherwise, and
#    it says which one it chose.
#
# YOU store the passphrase yourself, once, before starting the unit:
#
#   secret-tool store --label='personae vault' service personae-vault account "$USER"
#
# or, without a Secret Service:
#
#   install -m 600 /dev/null ~/.config/personae/passphrase
#   $EDITOR ~/.config/personae/passphrase   # one line, no trailing newline
#
# This script never handles the passphrase and never prints it.
#
# Re-run any time after changing personae; it stops the unit, installs fresh
# release bins, and restarts. Safe to run repeatedly.
