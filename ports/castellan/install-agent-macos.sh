# Build and (re)install the personae SSH agent + vault CLI on macOS.
#
# The macOS counterpart to install-agent-windows.ps1. Same shape: build the
# release bins from the mere workspace, install them, and register a
# launch-at-login job. Two things differ, and both are forced by the platform.
#
# 1. launchd replaces the VBS relaunch loop. Task Scheduler's restart policy
#    only covers failure to launch, not a crashed child, which is why the
#    Windows installer wraps the agent in a WScript loop. launchd's KeepAlive
#    genuinely restarts a crashed child, so the wrapper is unnecessary here.
#
# 2. There is no AutoOs unlock on macOS. `Unlock::AutoOs` is DPAPI, Windows
#    only; on every other platform bootstrap returns
#      "no OS auto-unlock backend on this platform yet; set PERSONAE_PASSPHRASE"
#    So the agent needs a passphrase at start. Writing it into the plist would
#    put the vault's KEK material in plaintext on disk and undo the point of a
#    sealed vault, so this installs a wrapper that reads it from the login
#    Keychain instead — the closest macOS equivalent of what DPAPI does for the
#    Windows path.
#
# YOU must store the passphrase yourself, once, before loading the job:
#
#   security add-generic-password -a "$USER" -s personae-vault -w
#
# (omit -w's value and it prompts, so the passphrase never lands in your shell
# history). This script never handles the passphrase and never prints it.
#
# Re-run any time after changing personae; it stops the job, copies fresh
# release bins, and reloads. Safe to run repeatedly.
