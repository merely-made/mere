# Build and (re)install the personae SSH agent + vault CLI on Windows.
#
# Interim scaffolding per the 2026-07-22 identity-vault-ssh-agent plan: the
# agent's durable home is the mere/Graphshell resident host, which will serve
# the agent (`castellan::custody::agent` since DR-B) in-process. Until then
# this installs the standalone bins and a logon scheduled task. Source is
# castellan here in mere (the bins moved from personae in DR-B; the
# standalone repos/personae was absorbed 2026-07-23), so rebuilds come from
# the mere workspace.
#
# Re-run any time after changing personae; it stops the task + process, copies
# fresh release bins, and restarts. Safe to run repeatedly.
