//! What this device can honestly say about itself.
//!
//! `mere-mesh` compares a [`DevicePolicy`] against a [`DeviceConditions`]
//! snapshot and never asks where the snapshot came from; `mesh-host` names the
//! seam ([`ConditionSource`]) and ships a hand-set stub. This module is the
//! real reading for the desktop resident.
//!
//! Three rules shape it:
//!
//! 1. **Sense what Windows will tell us without COM.** Idle time, power, link
//!    class, and in-use bandwidth come from plain Win32 calls —
//!    `GetLastInputInfo`, `GetSystemPowerStatus`, `GetAdaptersAddresses`,
//!    `GetIfEntry2`. No WMI, no WinRT, no COM apartment, because a desktop
//!    resident should not pay for one to read a battery.
//! 2. **Take the owner's word for the rest.** Package temperature is the one
//!    signal no route reaches honestly (see below), so it arrives as a
//!    [`StatedConditions`] value the device's owner wrote down.
//! 3. **Never invent the difference.** Every signal carries a
//!    [`SignalProvenance`], and a signal that is neither sensed nor stated is
//!    [`Absent`](SignalProvenance::Absent) — reported as the value that makes
//!    its policy rule *withhold*, never as a plausible-looking number.
//!
//! Rule 3 is only as good as its enforcement, which is why
//! [`validate_policy_coverage`] exists: it refuses, at composition time, a
//! policy whose enabled rules rest on absent signals. Without it, "never
//! fabricate" would be an aspiration; with it, a device physically cannot be
//! configured to decide on a number nobody measured.
//!
//! `local_hour` has no provenance field because both paths sense it: Windows
//! from `GetLocalTime`, everywhere else from chrono's local clock.
//!
//! ## Why thermal is an owner statement, on evidence
//!
//! The only COM-free route to a package temperature is the `Thermal Zone
//! Information` performance-counter set through PDH, which does read without
//! elevation. Measured on the development laptop (2026-09-02), `\_TZ.TZ01`
//! reported a constant 368.2 K (`High Precision` 3682) through idle, an 89%
//! CPU load burst, and the cool-down after it, with `Throttle Reasons` 0
//! throughout: the ACPI zone on this hardware is a static value, not a sensor.
//! `MSAcpi_ThermalZoneTemperature` over WMI is access-denied without elevation
//! and needs a COM apartment besides. A live temperature exists only through
//! vendor tools — `nvidia-smi` read the GPU at 75 °C — which are outside this
//! stack. A reading the policy would believe as sensed has to *move*, so
//! thermal stays an owner statement until hardware with a live ACPI zone is in
//! hand.
