//! Resident Distillery composition inside Djinn.
//!
//! Distillery owns the works: the supervisor loop, retention maintenance, and
//! blob custody for one mesh. Mesh owns job grammar and leases. Pandect owns
//! the device's lending posture. Personae owns the identity. This module is
//! only the place those authorities are put together, and its whole discipline
//! is that **it invents nothing**.
//!
//! That is a stronger claim than it sounds, so here is what it costs:
//!
//! - **No `DevicePolicy::permissive()`.** The lending policy is converted from
//!   pandect's device-scoped `mesh_lending` block. An enabled lane on a device
//!   with no such block is refused, because a composition that needs a lending
//!   posture and cannot find one must say so rather than lend everything.
//! - **No fabricated condition.** Conditions come from
//!   [`DeviceConditionSensor`], which reports each signal's provenance, and
//!   [`validate_policy_coverage`] refuses before the resident binds if any
//!   enabled rule rests on a signal nobody can supply. Thermal is not sensed on
//!   this platform, so a `max_thermal_c` above zero with no stated temperature
//!   refuses composition — loudly, at start, rather than by never lending.
//! - **No invented capacity.** [`mesh::HostFacts::memory_mib`] is read from the
//!   operating system — `GlobalMemoryStatusEx` on Windows, `MemTotal:` from
//!   `/proc/meminfo` on Linux, the `hw.memsize` sysctl on macOS — and a build
//!   on a target with none of those refuses rather than advertising a number.
//! - **No unearned GPU.** [`mesh::HostFacts::gpu`] follows the resource this
//!   composition actually registered, never the hardware present. A `"gpu"`
//!   trainer is composed only after Distillery's adapter probe says the wgpu
//!   runtime would bind a real discrete adapter — because cubecl, asked for a
//!   discrete GPU it cannot find, substitutes an unclassified adapter instead
//!   of refusing. A machine with a GPU and a CPU trainer on it still
//!   advertises `false`.
//! - **No borrowed identity.** The mesh id is derived under Distillery's own
//!   salt from the same Personae profile Djinn resolved, and the retention
//!   checkpoint authority is that profile's derived mesh author.
//!
//! ## What this lane deliberately does not adopt
//!
//! It builds its own [`transport::P2pandaTransport`] and its own job-byte
//! store, exactly as [`InstalledAuthority::bind_resident`] already does. It
//! does **not** borrow Djinn's shared [`crate::resident_blobs`] custody. Mesh
//! job payloads are governed by a mesh retention policy with its own checkpoint
//! authority, and personal-graph transfers and Knot evidence are governed by
//! their own leases; folding them into one physical store would make one
//! policy's collection decision reach into another policy's bytes.
