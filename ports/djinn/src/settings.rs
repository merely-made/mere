//! Persisted owner settings for the Djinn resident.
//!
//! Durable configuration used to live only in the launcher's argument list,
//! which made every lasting choice (which graph, which lanes, which paired
//! devices) a property of a shell script rather than of the owner's profile.
//! Reinstalling the host, or editing the wrong wrapper, silently changed what
//! the device synchronised.
//!
//! Three boundaries hold here:
//!
//! - **Not in the credential vault.** Graphshell's storage lives under its own
//!   application directory. The Personae vault holds secrets and performs
//!   cryptographic operations; the two do not merge storage domains, even
//!   though the vault directory happened to be where the data root landed
//!   first. [`migrate_data_root`] moves that history forward.
//! - **One file per Personae profile.** A work face and a burner face do not
//!   share a paired-device roster or a set of enabled lanes, so cross-persona
//!   linkage stays opt-in.
//! - **Nothing secret.** Node ids and roster roots are public keys. Seeds,
//!   private keys, vault roots and decrypted slot payloads stay in Personae and
//!   never reach this file.
