//! The receipt for the Distillery lane: a resident started from nothing but
//! owner-stated policy runs a real mesh job to completion on the wall clock and
//! shuts down clean.
//!
//! Everything here goes through [`DjinnResident::open`] rather than straight to
//! `ResidentDistillery::open`, because the claim being proved is a claim about
//! *composition*: the lane is opened in construction order behind credentials,
//! blob custody and Knot, and it is closed by the resident's own ordered
//! shutdown. Nothing in this file dials a broker or builds a graph session, so
//! the extra path costs one Castellan claim and one blob-store open.
//!
//! Four properties are load-bearing, and each has its own refusal:
//!
//! 1. **No permissive default.** The installed policy is asserted to be the
//!    converted device settings and asserted *not* to be
//!    [`DevicePolicy::permissive`].
//! 2. **No fabricated condition.** A thermal limit on a machine with no
//!    thermometer and no stated temperature refuses composition by name.
//! 3. **No assumed lending posture.** An enabled lane on a device that has
//!    never stated one refuses rather than lending everything.
//! 4. **No feature the build does not carry.** A lane whose settings name a
//!    trainer refuses on a build compiled without the `trainer` feature. That
//!    test lives here, under `cfg(not(feature = "trainer"))`, so the gate has a
//!    live assertion in *both* feature sets: the composed half is proved by
//!    `distillery_trainer.rs`, the refusing half by this file.
//!
//! The clock is [`distillery::mesh_host::SystemClock`] throughout — there is no
//! `ManualClock` here, because a lease is a wall-clock promise and a receipt
//! taken on a hand-set clock would not be a receipt about this device.

/// `HostFacts` refuses to invent, so it is the one thing that decides where
/// this receipt is a receipt.
///
/// Off Windows nothing about the device is *sensed*, and the run leans on the
/// fixture's stated fallbacks instead. That is not a weakening of the claim:
/// `common::lending` enables exactly one rule, `min_idle_ms`, and states an
/// idle time for it; battery, thermal, network and bandwidth are each switched
/// off by the owner, for reasons the fixture's own docs give. A rule left
/// enabled with nothing sensed and nothing stated behind it would refuse
/// composition on such a machine rather than pass quietly — which is exactly
/// what the thermal test below proves, on purpose.
