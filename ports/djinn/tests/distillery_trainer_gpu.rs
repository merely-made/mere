//! The receipt for the GPU-composed trainer: the same lane, the same synthetic
//! fixture, the same forcing question — what does `device: "gpu"` do on *this*
//! machine, with the adapter named rather than assumed.
//!
//! `distillery_trainer.rs` already proves the composition on the CPU. This file
//! changes exactly one field, `distillery.trainer.device` from `"cpu"` to
//! `"gpu"`, and there are two honest answers to that, decided by hardware and
//! not by the test: a machine with a discrete adapter must train on it, and a
//! machine without one must be *refused*. The receipt asks
//! [`distillery::probe_gpu_adapter`] which machine it is on, prints the
//! answer, and then proves the corresponding claim. Neither branch is a skip;
//! a log reader can tell from the printed branch line which of the two this
//! run proved.
//!
//! ## The discrete branch
//!
//! Three things that word is supposed to mean:
//!
//! 1. **The adapter is the discrete GPU, and it was checked.**
//!    [`ResidentDistillery::trainer_adapter`] reports the adapter the wgpu
//!    runtime named *before* the device was constructed, and it is asserted to
//!    be `Discrete`, matched out of the discrete class rather than substituted.
//!    This is the load-bearing assertion of the whole file. cubecl's
//!    `select_from_adapter_list`, asked for `DiscreteGpu(0)` on a machine with
//!    no discrete adapter, falls through to the unclassified `Other` list and
//!    returns whatever is there; it panics only when that list is short too.
//!    A receipt that merely observed "the job completed on device gpu" would
//!    pass identically on a machine that had quietly run on an integrated
//!    adapter, which is the exact failure this lane was built to refuse.
//! 2. **The advertised fact followed the composition.** `HostFacts::gpu` is
//!    read back off the *installed* host, the same way the CPU receipt reads
//!    the installed policy, and asserted `true`. Composing a GPU trainer and
//!    advertising no GPU, or advertising a GPU with no GPU resource behind it,
//!    are both lies to the ring; this checks the one that can happen here.
//! 3. **Real training happened on it.** The same synthetic llama fixture, the
//!    same held-out partition, the same trainer job — driven through the
//!    resident on `SystemClock` to `Step::Completed`, and the committed
//!    `TrainReceipt` read back out of the blob space. Both trainer arms this
//!    build carries, in sequence on the one composed adapter: the lane hands
//!    the resource the *inner* wgpu device it probed, and the autodiff trainer
//!    wraps that with `Device::autodiff` itself, so the arm changes nothing
//!    about the composition and everything about what runs on it.
//!
//! The tally assertion is deliberately *strict improvement* and nothing
//! sharper. The CPU receipt's 6/6-against-4/6 numbers are ndarray's; f32
//! reductions on a GPU need not reproduce them bit for bit, and pinning the
//! exact figures would make this a test about floating-point luck rather than
//! about the trainer. What the receipt owes is the measurement it actually
//! took, printed, plus the claim that the adapter beat the untuned base on
//! held-out cases.
//!
//! ## The refusing branch
//!
//! On a machine with no discrete adapter — an integrated-only laptop, an Apple
//! GPU, which wgpu classes as `IntegratedGpu`, a headless box — the claim under
//! test is the *refusal*, and it is the more valuable of the two: it is the
//! branch where cubecl would have handed the lane something it did not ask for.
//! The receipt asserts that opening the resident with `device: "gpu"` fails,
//! that the refusal names both the setting it refused and the adapter facts
//! that were found instead (or the absence, when nothing was found), and that
//! no resident was composed. Passing here without training anything is the
//! whole point: the lane declining to advertise a GPU it cannot name is the
//! behaviour, not a shortfall of it.
//!
//! It runs wherever the lane composes at all — Windows, Linux and macOS, the
//! three platforms this crate can read physical memory on, which is the one
//! fact `HostFacts` refuses to invent.
