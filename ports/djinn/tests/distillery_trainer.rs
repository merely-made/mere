//! The receipt for the Djinn-composed trainer: a resident opened from nothing
//! but owner-stated policy trains a real LoRA adapter and leaves it in the
//! persona's own model library.
//!
//! `distillery/tests/trainer.rs` already proves the *resource* works, over a
//! hand-built one-host mesh and a `MemoryBackend`. This file proves the
//! *composition*: the same resource reached by the path a desktop actually
//! takes — [`DjinnResident::open`], the profile's derived mesh author, the
//! device's stated lending posture, a `SystemClock`, and a concrete
//! `RedbBackend` on disk under the persona's data root.
//!
//! Three things are load-bearing here that the resource's own receipt cannot
//! say:
//!
//! 1. **The posture permits the trainer by name.** `allowed_resources` is
//!    exactly `["esp.train.peft-lora/v1"]`, asserted against the *installed*
//!    policy after open, so this run is admitted because the owner said so and
//!    not because the set was empty.
//! 2. **The artifacts land somewhere durable and persona-scoped.** The library
//!    file is asserted to exist at the derived
//!    `<data_root>/models/<profile>/library.redb` — not in the personal-graph
//!    store, and not under a mesh root whose retention policy could collect it.
//! 3. **The gate is honest in both directions.** This file only compiles with
//!    the `trainer` feature; `distillery_lane.rs` carries the matching
//!    `cfg(not(feature = "trainer"))` refusal, so neither feature set is
//!    without a live assertion about the gate. The same pattern one word in:
//!    the refusal below runs under `cfg(not(feature = "trainer-gpu"))`, and
//!    `distillery_trainer_gpu.rs` is its composing half.
//!
//! 4. **Both arms, or the refusal.** A build carrying `trainer-autodiff` runs
//!    the v1 request on the same lane, right after the v0 one, and its
//!    published manifest is checked for the v1 stamp and trainer name. A build
//!    without it posts the identical request and is checked to *release* it
//!    and commit nothing — refused loudly rather than composed diminished,
//!    the same posture the GPU gate takes about the device.
//!
//! The run itself stays on the CPU under both feature sets. `device: "cpu"` is
//! not incidental here — it is what makes this receipt a statement about the
//! composed *path* rather than about whatever hardware the machine has, and it
//! is what lets the GPU receipt's tallies be compared against something.
//!
//! It runs wherever the lane composes, for the same reason the lane receipt
//! does: the one fact `HostFacts` will not invent is physical memory, and this
//! crate reads that on Windows, Linux and macOS. The device conditions it
//! leans on off Windows are the fixture's stated fallbacks — see
//! `common::lending`, whose docs carry the pairing that keeps them honest.
//! Nothing else here is platform-shaped: the model library path is derived
//! with `Path::join` under a `tempfile` root, and the training is `ndarray` on
//! the CPU.
