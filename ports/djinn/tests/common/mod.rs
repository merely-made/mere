//! Fixtures shared by the Distillery lane receipts.
//!
//! Three integration tests open the same resident from the same kind of owner
//! statement — `distillery_lane.rs` proves the lane runs a job at all,
//! `distillery_trainer.rs` proves the trainer it composes produces real
//! artifacts, and `distillery_trainer_gpu.rs` proves the same composition on
//! this machine's discrete GPU — and a second copy of the vault, profile,
//! device-settings and lending-posture setup would be a place for the receipts
//! to silently disagree about what "the same device" means.
//!
//! The GPU receipt sharing this fixture is load-bearing rather than tidy: its
//! tallies are only interpretable against the CPU receipt's because both runs
//! train on byte-identical weights and the same held-out partition.
//!
//! The trainer half (behind the `trainer` feature) additionally carries the
//! tiny synthetic llama fixture. That is one more copy of the fixture that
//! lives in `distillery/tests/trainer.rs`, and it is deliberate: the two
//! crates share no dev-dependency seam, and inventing a fixture crate to hold
//! sixty lines of deterministic weights would cost more than the duplication
//! does.

// Each test binary compiles this module whole and uses a different part of it,
// so an unused helper here means "the other receipt wanted it", not "nobody
// does".

///   a plane) would withhold forever and these receipts would hang instead of
///   failing. The floor is exercised by unit conversion, not by these runs.

/// `min_idle_ms: 1` is the enabled rule the sensor genuinely covers: sensed
/// from `GetLastInputInfo` on Windows, and stated below so the same settings
/// are coverable anywhere. A machine actively driving a test run is rarely
/// idle, so `stated.idle_ms` is what a run actually leans on — the owner's
/// word standing in for a reading that would otherwise withhold forever.
///
/// Taken together that is what lets these receipts run off Windows, where
/// nothing is sensed at all: `validate_policy_coverage` refuses an enabled
/// rule resting on an absent signal, one rule is enabled, and that one rule
/// has a stated value. The invariant to keep is that pairing — enabling a rule
/// here without stating a fallback for it would compose on Windows and refuse
/// everywhere else, which is precisely the shape of bug a Windows-only receipt
/// used to hide.
///
/// `allowed_resources` and `accepted_checkpoints` are stated narrowly rather
