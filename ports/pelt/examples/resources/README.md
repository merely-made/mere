# resources

Test fixture assets that Pelt's example documents reference **by repository-root
relative path**, carried here with Pelt when it landed from genet 2026-09-03
(`design_docs/archive_docs/2026-10-06_completed_plans/2026-09-02_platform_boundary_and_repository_topology_plan.md`).

They sat at the repository root until 2026-09-03, when Mark ruled that two
Servo-derived fixture PNGs are not a top-level directory's worth of repository.
They now live under Pelt, next to the fixtures that use them. The authored URLs
still climb to the repository root — four, five and six `..` segments, exactly
as before — and then descend into `ports/pelt/examples/resources/`, because
`ports/pelt/desktop/static_viewer.rs` asserts on those strings: the tests
exercise relative URL resolution at each of those depths, so the climb is the
thing under test and it is preserved.

| file | referenced by |
|---|---|
| `servo_64.png` | `ports/pelt/examples/livery-route/` (the `article` product receipt) and `ports/pelt/examples/p5-resources/` |
| `servo_1024.png` | `ports/pelt/examples/livery-scripted-route/index.html` |

Both are byte-identical copies of genet's `resources/`, which is Servo-derived.
They are fixture inputs, not shipped product assets.
