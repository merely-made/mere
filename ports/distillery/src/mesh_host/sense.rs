//! The two seams that touch the world.
//!
//! `mere-mesh` reads no clock and asks the OS nothing; that is what makes its
//! fold deterministic and its projection honest. Every such reading enters
//! here, behind a trait, so a receipt can drive a supervisor with a clock it
//! controls and a battery that never existed.
//!
//! A real host implements [`ConditionSource`] over whatever it can actually
//! observe — idle time, power, thermals, link class. Nothing below this crate
//! is allowed to care how.
