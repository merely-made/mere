//! **Athanor**, the distillation furnace of Distillery, the Mere platform's
//! works.
//!
//! An athanor is the furnace that holds a constant low heat for as long as
//! the work takes. This crate is the authority half of the `alembic`
//! workshop: what a furnace pass is, what it may propose — distillation,
//! cleanup, facet proposals — and the grants, runs, pending petitions,
//! refusals, costs, pause, revoke, retry, and dissolve over the bounded actors
//! the workshop admits, of which the furnace was always the first.
//!
//! Two rules it keeps:
//!
//! - **It proposes; it never owns truth.** A furnace pass emits proposals,
//!   and the authority that owns the affected store decides. Athanor is not
//!   a graph-truth authority and does not become one.
//! - **It is scheduled, not resident.** Djinn contains the scheduler and runs
//!   Athanor as one resident service, composing this crate the way it
//!   composes Distillery's works — putting owners together and inventing
//!   nothing. Lifetime is Djinn's; the domain is Distillery's.
//!
//! Ruled 2026-09-02: the authority lives with the domain, by the precedent
//! Djinn set for the works. Beside `alembic` at `ports/distillery/athanor`.
//! The package is `mere-athanor`; the library keeps the name.
//!
//! The furnace's passes are below. Scheduling them as one job kind on the
//! works' board, carried into the board's Chronicle by the projection walk
//! plan, is still to come.
//!
//! ## Passes
//!
//! The forgetting pass: propose which short-term cached content to evict, and
//! apply an accepted proposal by dropping that content.
//!
//! Athanor is the distillation daemon (Alembic plan slice D) — eventually an
//! [armillary](https://crates.io/crates/armillary) actor running steady-heat in the
//! background. This crate holds its pure pass *logic*, separate from the actor that
//! will schedule it, so it tests without a runtime. It honours eidetic **R0**: the
//! `propose_*` half is pure (reads a snapshot, mutates nothing), and the `apply_*`
//! half drops only short-term **cached content** (`content_store` blobs), never graph
//! truth (nodes / edges stay) and never codicils (immutable). Forgetting is the one
//! place blobs are dropped, and it drops only auto-captured short-term memory.
//!
//! Facet extraction is the pass still to come (graph codicils are already
//! deduplicated by content-addressing, so consolidation stays light).
//!
//! Consolidation (the second pass) relates graph codicils that are
//! successive versions of the same material — significant URL overlap — but carry
//! no lineage link yet. Composing is the *only* way eidetic offers to link two
//! already-saved manifests (they are immutable; there is no post-hoc amendment), so
//! `apply_consolidation` reuses [`graph_codicil::compose_graph_codicils`]. That is
//! content-addressed, so re-linking an already-consolidated pair on a later pass is
//! a safe no-op (same bytes, same id) rather than a duplicate.
