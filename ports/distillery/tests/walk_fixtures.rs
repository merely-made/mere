//! W0 receipt: the projection walk's two second datasets, plus the bare
//! headless scenario that drives the installed surface end to end.
//!
//! Nothing here renders a scene, and nothing here reads a projection contract.
//! W0 only has to leave three things on disk and under test:
//!
//! - **Chronicle's second dataset.** Two job boards in the same grammar with
//!   different owners — Distillery's and Djinn's — so the authored Chronicle
//!   definition of W2 has something to be pointed at twice. Both are folded
//!   from an authored `MeshEvent` history, never from a live mesh, so the
//!   fixture a reader diffs is the fixture the fold produces.
//! - **Circuit's second dataset.** Mere's own workspace dependency graph.
//!   This one is *derived*, not authored: the test runs `cargo metadata`
//!   itself, writes the graph under `CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR`, and reads it back.
//!   A committed snapshot of the member list falls a generation behind every
//!   time a crate is added, so there is no committed snapshot any more.
//! - **The bare scenario.** `distillery.installed.v1` composed against a
//!   scripted DOM and driven by its own runner, with one exact resident
//!   receipt observed. This is the skeleton the headed genet-probe receipts of
//!   W1 and W4 grow from.
//!
//! Every identity here is seeded and every instant is authored, so two runs
//! produce the same bytes. That is the whole point of a fixture: the board is
//! a claim-race, and a claim-race is only reviewable if it lands the same way
//! twice.
