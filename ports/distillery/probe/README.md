# Distillery browser model probe

This is D2's development surface, homed with the model-works port without
turning the probe into product chrome. It runs a pinned real-model matrix
through the Eidetic `ModelLibrary`, Muniment IndexedDB, ESP's BERT and Llama
loaders, and Burn WGPU inside dedicated browser workers.

The probe is a standalone Cargo workspace. This keeps an evidence-only browser
surface from widening Mere's ordinary product graph and lets it build while
unrelated headed ports move between Genet host generations.

From the Mere root:

```powershell
cargo binstall wasm-bindgen-cli@0.2.122 --root C:\path\to\wasm-bindgen-0.2.122
ports/distillery/probe/fetch-model-matrix.ps1
ports/distillery/probe/run-probe.ps1 `
  -WasmBindgen C:\path\to\wasm-bindgen-0.2.122\bin\wasm-bindgen.exe
```

The fetch command verifies every configured byte count and SHA-256 before
installing the ignored local artifacts. The standalone lockfile pins selected
versions, but `run-probe.ps1` cannot use Cargo's `--locked` flag: inherited
path-workspace patch tables make Cargo reorder semantically identical
`patch.unused` entries. The checked-in package selections and exact
wasm-bindgen CLI pin remain the reproducibility boundary.

Open the printed URL in a headed Chromium browser and select **Run configured
matrix**. `window.distilleryModelProbe.runSuite(modelId)` runs one configured
embedding row, `runMatrix()` runs those rows in ascending artifact size,
`runDecoder()` runs the pinned SmolLM2 decoder row, and `receipt()` returns the
machine-readable result. The decoder row records every generated token and
fragment, first-token latency, post-first-token throughput, cold/warm output
identity, cooperative token-boundary cancellation, explicit device teardown,
and stream messages observed by the page. Generated wasm and model artifacts
stay out of Git; selected dated decision receipts are checked in when
they substantiate a boundary.

The native remote fixture is a separate two-peer forcing proof for the same
MiniLM row. It mounts Distillery's production Burn protocol on one real
p2panda/Iroh endpoint, connects from a second, loads ESP's BERT model onto an
authorized remote device, and runs the server on native WGPU. The receipt uses
plain WGPU with Fusion and autotune disabled. It also observes CubeCL's
process-local allocator across all server-device streams. The default command
keeps the passing lease/reclaim/recovery proof small:

```powershell
ports/distillery/probe/run-remote-minilm.ps1
```

`-Matrix` builds plain and Fusion/autotune profiles separately, then runs local
and remote MiniLM once each in fresh processes. Every row has a configurable
outer timeout and separate stdout/stderr capture. A failing combined remote row
automatically adds local/remote Fusion-only and autotune-only diagnostics.

The fixture compares all 384 remote values with ESP's native control and the
first eight with this probe's pinned BrowserWebGpu reference. It then reclaims
the lease while a configurable model batch is still in flight, requires the
request to fail without hanging, requires active CubeCL allocations and bytes
in use to return exactly to baseline, and repeats the numerical and cleanup
proof under a fresh lease and session. Reserved allocator bytes are recorded
but are not a live-allocation gate. The base fixture's receipt remains scoped
to allocator telemetry.
Unlike the browser workspace, this nested fixture has a stable committed lock
and runs Cargo from outside the checkout with `--locked`, so gitignored local
patch redirects cannot contaminate the receipt. It explicitly patches to
Mere's production Burn Remote and CubeCL sources and restates Mere's p2panda
fork because nested workspaces do not inherit the root patch table. The first
passing machine receipt is
[`receipts/2026-08-23_remote_minilm.json`](receipts/2026-08-23_remote_minilm.json).
The allocator and feature-sidequest summary is
[`receipts/2026-08-25_remote_minilm_sidequests.json`](receipts/2026-08-25_remote_minilm_sidequests.json).

On Windows with `typeperf.exe` and `nvidia-smi.exe`, the separate physical
driver-memory gate is:

```powershell
ports/distillery/probe/measure-remote-minilm-vram.ps1
```

It holds the fixture at each lifecycle stage, sums the Windows per-PID
`GPU Process Memory` dedicated-byte counters, and uses `nvidia-smi pmon` to
attribute the active PID to NVIDIA GPU 0. The gate requires both active cycles
to release at least 64 MiB, permits at most 32 MiB of retained growth across
reclaims, and requires the PID counter to disappear after process exit. Board
memory totals are contextual only. The first passing receipt is
[`receipts/2026-08-25_remote_minilm_driver_vram.json`](receipts/2026-08-25_remote_minilm_driver_vram.json).

## Claim boundary

The 2026-08-22 D2c embedding matrix passes all four configured rows in a clean
headed Chromium 151 build: [BGE Micro v2](https://huggingface.co/TaylorAI/bge-micro-v2),
MiniLM-L6-v2, [E5-small-v2](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-small-v2), and
[E5-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-base-v2). Their weight
artifacts range from 34,785,664-byte F16 through 437,955,512-byte F32. Every
cold and warm output is finite, unit norm, stable within and across workers,
and within `1.416e-7` of its independent PyTorch/Transformers reference.
IndexedDB integrity reopen, termination at `executing`, the 300 ms quiet
window, and WebGPU error scopes pass for every row. See the
[browser matrix receipt](receipts/2026-08-22_d2c_browser_matrix.json) and
[native control](receipts/2026-08-22_d2c_native_matrix.json).

BGE's published F16 artifact forced one narrow ESP extension: the safetensors
loader now accepts F16 weights and promotes them to Burn f32 tensors. Other
published dtypes still fail explicitly. This is loader-format support, not a
new model adapter.

The root defect is a same-allocation binary launch in Burn/CubeCL. The published
`burn-cubecl 0.22.0-pre.2` path binds one allocation twice when evaluating a
graph such as `x.clone() * x`. Chromium executes that shape without a
validation error but returns stale storage. Scalar operations and two
independently uploaded operands pass. Burn LayerNorm uses the shared-input shape
for its variance and therefore returned the input unchanged.

Mere carries a narrow `burn-cubecl` backport: detect equal logical allocation
and view identity, bind the storage once, alias the second logical input to the
first binding, and write to a distinct output. The
[model-free receipt](repros/burn_browser_embedding/receipts/2026-08-22_binary_alias_iab.json)
records the unpatched failure, two rejected fix hypotheses, and the passing
backport. The existing Cubek extrema materialization patch remains independently
required.

Frame p95 stayed below the configured 33.4 ms bound in every idle, cold,
cancellation, and warm phase. The clean matrix still recorded 41 isolated
over-bound intervals; the largest was 175.8 ms during E5-base warm reopen. The
receipt keeps those spikes visible rather than treating p95 as a complete UI
smoothness claim.

This matrix proves the eager five-copy artifact ladder, worker-owned IndexedDB,
F16/F32 BERT construction, numerical BrowserWebGpu execution, worker
termination, message cutoff, and warm reopen through the 438 MB embedding row.
The browser denied persistent-storage promotion, so the stored rows remained
best effort even though same-origin warm reopen passed.

The first configured decoder row also passes in clean headed Chromium. Pinned
SmolLM2-135M-Instruct reopens from IndexedDB, streams eight fragments across
both cold and warm worker boundaries, and matches the independent Transformers
and ESP NdArray ids exactly. First-token and post-first-token timing, frame
impact, and GPU-error scopes are recorded in the
[decoder receipt](receipts/2026-08-22_d2c_browser_decoder.json). A second clean
[lifecycle receipt](receipts/2026-08-22_d2c_browser_decoder_lifecycle.json)
emits one fragment before cancellation, acknowledges the request, emits zero
later fragments, and records a one-token partial ESP result. It then destroys
the worker's one tracked `GPUDevice` without error, terminates with no late
messages in the 300 ms quiet window, and exactly reproduces all eight tokens in
a fresh worker.

This completes D2c's configured embedding phase and establishes one decoder
ceiling. Physical GPU-memory release remains unobservable because the browser
exposes no allocation telemetry; host-controlled device teardown is proven. A
product default remains open. Trainers remain outside this ceiling probe.

## 2026-09-29 migration annotation: upstream Burn-CubeCL

Ruling 410 retires the burn-cubecl selector on the pre.4 migration branch after
the reconstructed pre.2 browser failure and upstream pre.4 success in the same
browser, plus nine matching native unfused launcher controls. Root, this probe,
the remote fixture and embedding fixture now select pristine registry pre.4.
Other patch policies remain independently selected. The migration plan §13.28
and embedding reproducer receipts preserve the evidence and qualifications.
The remaining model, extrema, two-peer lifecycle and integration gates remain
open at this annotation; this does not turn historical receipts into new ones.

## 2026-10-03 migration annotation: repaired close path (ruling 508)

On the pre.4 branch, burn-remote's close now waits for the device to finish
releasing a session's allocations, and reports a failed wait instead of
acknowledging a clean close (`support/patches/burn-remote/MERE-PATCH.md`).
The remote fixture also guards its native-reference comparison against
non-finite values. It adds a second-live-lease stage: one lease closes through
its holder's revoke while another stays live on the same device and must keep
its lease, its session, identical output and its share of the allocator. The
first passing receipt of this fixture on pre.4 is
[`receipts/2026-10-03_pre4_remote_minilm_repaired.json`](receipts/2026-10-03_pre4_remote_minilm_repaired.json).
Migration plan §13.32 records its commands, controls and qualifications.
