# BrowserWebGpu silently corrupts binary ops with the same tensor as both inputs

## Summary

On Burn `0.22.0-pre.2` / CubeCL `0.11.0-pre.2`, BrowserWebGpu returns stale or
unmodified storage when a binary tensor operation receives two logical handles
to the same allocation. No WebGPU validation error is reported.

This breaks Burn LayerNorm because its variance path evaluates
`centered.clone() * centered`. The exact Burn LayerNorm unit input and an
`8 x 384` BERT-width input both return the original input unchanged in headed
Chromium 151 on Windows/NVIDIA Lovelace. Native WGPU passes.

Burn main at `2c06be351006851d42fdb6df16b976f4a82d9747` and CubeCL main at
`4057f39e7fe025323e032bab8fc7600d16414f5e` were source-audited on 2026-08-22;
the same launch and handle-count paths remain. Those main revisions were not
runtime-tested by this receipt.

## Minimal discriminator

```rust
let input = Tensor::<2>::from_data(
    TensorData::new(vec![-0.6897_f32, -2.7106, 2.2222, -1.0330], [1, 4]),
    &device,
);

let shared = input.clone() * input;
// BrowserWebGpu: incorrect.

let lhs = Tensor::<2>::from_data(data.clone(), &device);
let rhs = Tensor::<2>::from_data(data, &device);
let independent = lhs * rhs;
// BrowserWebGpu: correct.
```

Scalar multiplication also passes. The failure therefore is not generic
multiplication, upload, reduction, output allocation, model size, or queued
work.

## Observed results

- Eleven embedding controls pass, including exact MiniLM table geometry and
  model-sized upload pressure.
- `tensor.clone() * tensor` fails with maximum absolute error `7.347352`.
- Two independent, equal uploads multiply exactly.
- Burn's ten-value LayerNorm returns its input, maximum error `0.7426002`.
- BERT-width LayerNorm returns its input, maximum error `0.50517905`.
- GPU error scopes are empty.
- The exact 90,868,376-byte MiniLM artifact passes the native WGPU fixture.

## Cause and tested fix shape

`burn-cubecl/src/kernel/binary.rs::launch_binop` binds `lhs` and `rhs` as two
inputs. When both are clones of one tensor, both bindings point to the same
logical allocation. The existing output-alias branch is not the cause:
disabling in-place output selection and allocating a distinct output still
fails.

A tested fix does three things:

1. expose whether two CubeCL handles name the same logical allocation and view;
2. bind that allocation once;
3. pass the second logical tensor argument as an alias of input zero, with a
   distinct output allocation.

That form passes shared add/multiply, variance, exact LayerNorm, BERT-width
LayerNorm, and all embedding controls in headed Chromium with empty error
scopes. Mere carries the experiment as a temporary backport in
`support/patches/burn-cubecl` and `support/patches/cubecl-runtime`.

The same guard was applied to Burn's numeric, integer, and float binary
launchers. The receipt exercises the numeric path; upstream should add backend
coverage for the integer and float-family launchers as well.

## 2026-09-29 disposition

The historical pre.2 dependency row still reproduces this failure in the current
browser. The pre.4 dependency row passes all ten graph and eleven embedding
cases in the same session without Mere's burn-cubecl patch; nine native unfused
launcher controls also match the patched row. Ruling 410 therefore retires the
four selectors on the migration branch. This identifies a dependency-stack
difference, not a particular upstream fix, and preserves the original report's
historical scope. Exact comparison receipts are linked from this fixture's README.
