//! Live host-side enforcement for one sited-station grant.
//!
//! A station lease is deliberately local to Signalman's port. Retinue receives
//! only the typed station identity; it never reads a wallet, clock, or grant.
//! The port reloads the current host grant on every lease check. A replacement
//! may extend the deadline before it passes, while expiry, revocation, a stale
//! roster, or a bad signature permanently closes this running lease.
