//! Signalman's Persona-backed Retinue station adapter.
//!
//! This port is the only layer here that knows both Castellan/Personae and
//! Retinue. It derives a station-scoped Reticulum identity, binds its signing
//! key to Castellan's narrow expiring RemoteAuth grant, and opens Retinue only
//! behind a lease that stops the running station at expiry. Retinue does not
//! know where the credential came from and never creates a local account file.
