# Signalman

Signalman is Mere's private Retinue-management port. It obtains the operator
identity from Castellan/Personae, derives a station-scoped Reticulum identity,
binds its Ed25519 half to a narrow, expiring RemoteAuth grant, and hands the
typed identity to Retinue's host library. The grant permits only
`transport.egress`, has no persona or private-read authority, and fails closed
at expiry. Retinue itself owns no Mere, Personae, or Castellan dependency.

Grant, renewal, revocation, and acknowledgement travel as bounded signed
control bodies inside normal authenticated LXMF messages. The Persona signs
each control frame through a device-specific attested child; the station signs
the acknowledgement with its derived Reticulum identity. A receiver accepts an
exact retransmission after a lost acknowledgement, but accepts a replacement
only before its prior deadline and only when the expiry grows. The receiver's
snapshot is non-secret state to persist beside the device's delegated identity.
`SitedStationHead` seals both through a caller-provided `SealedRecordStorage`,
persists an accepted transition before returning its acknowledgement, and
checks the receiver before every public radio operation. The process that
selects a board's secure-storage root remains deployment-owned. The
`mere-signalman-provision` command creates that sealed record without exposing
the derived private identity:

```text
mere-signalman-provision \
  --authority-root PATH \
  --station-root PATH \
  --record RELATIVE_PATH \
  --label NAME \
  --expires-hours HOURS
```

The command requires an explicit finite grant duration, installs the signed
grant before the radio opens, verifies the station-signed acknowledgement, and
refuses to replace an existing record. It prints only public receipt fields.
The physical radio receipt remains deployment work.

For a physically witnessed V4 first-owner claim, initialize the separate
controller scope explicitly, after the command has read the existing wallet
without migrating its sealed or legacy seed record:

```text
mere-signalman-first-owner init \
  --authority-root PATH
```

`init` refuses a missing or locked wallet, creates
`first-owner-controller-id.json` exactly once with create-new semantics, and
prints only the resulting public controller fingerprint. It never opens USB.
Its current create-new final-file write is not atomic: if interruption leaves
malformed public scope JSON, `claim` fails closed. Before any board claim, the
operator may remove only that public scope file and rerun `init`.
The later `claim` action requires that existing scope and also reads the
wallet without creating an unlock root, wallet, or identity:

```text
mere-signalman-first-owner claim \
  --authority-root PATH \
  --port COM6 \
  --region us915 \
  --frequency-hz 906875000 \
  --bandwidth-hz 250000 \
  --tx-power-dbm 17
```

The `claim` invocation itself is a durable board mutation after a fresh
physical presence window. It is not run automatically by this port or its
tests. Initializing a controller scope is not a board claim, and no physical
Claim or Resume receipt exists yet.

After a claim, `status` asks the running board for its control status under
the same controller identity, over the ordinary USB modem stream, with no
button gesture:

```text
mere-signalman-first-owner status \
  --authority-root PATH \
  --port COM6 \
  --node NODE_HEX
```

The board verifies the signed command against its durable grant and journals
the outer replay counter before it answers, so `status` keeps that counter in
`first-owner-controller-counter.json` beside the scope record and advances it,
with a synced temporary file and rename, before every send. A counter the
board has already accepted is refused with silence; the command then reports a
carrier timeout. The record starts at one for a freshly claimed board and is
never rewound by this port.

This integration package is a member of Mere's workspace (since the p2panda
0.7.5 repin, device pairing plan ruling 35) and pins the Retinue source
revision consumed by downstream Signalman builds. It is not a
publishable dependency story.
The portable boundary is `postilion::StationConfig`, which accepts a supplied
`PrivateIdentity`; this port is its first real Persona-backed consumer.

Linkboy remains below this port. Its package policy, immutable plans,
execution, recovery, and rescue CLI do not depend on Signalman or Mere.
