//! The live half of the WebRTC door: the join sequence over a real channel,
//! and the admitted session it produces.
//!
//! [`crate::webrtc_door`] is deliberately sans-I/O — bytes in, bytes out,
//! every rule testable without a socket. This module is where those bytes
//! actually travel. It stays as thin as that division demands: the sequence
//! below contains no signature check, no use-count, no policy rule. Every one
//! of those lives in the door and is exercised by the door's fail-closed
//! matrix; what is tested here is only that the messages arrive in order and
//! that each refusal is *written to the peer* before the channel closes.
//!
//! ## Frames for the join, a stream for the application
//!
//! The join travels as carrier frames — four JSON messages and two binary
//! ones — because frames give the door's bytes-in/bytes-out functions their
//! message boundaries for free. Only after admission does
//! [`stream_over_frames`] start,
//! and the byte stream it presents carries the ordinary NDJSON session that
//! [`crate::session_loop::serve_admitted_session`] already speaks. The pump
//! starting *after* the admission reply is what keeps the plan's rule — a
//! refused stream never reaches Graphshell — structural rather than
//! disciplinary: before that point there is no stream for an application
//! byte to be on.
//!
//! ## The sequence
//!
//! ```text
//! browser                                   host
//!   |-- Open { invite, client_nonce } ------->|
//!   |<------ Challenge { server_nonce, sig } -|   host signs the transcript
//!   |   (browser verifies against the         |
//!   |    invitation's expected host key)      |
//!   |-- Redeem { subject, proof } ----------->|   one use spent, or Refused
//!   |<------------- Grant { delegation } -----|
//!   |-- hello bytes (binary frame) ---------->|   Notochord admission
//!   |<---------- reply bytes (binary frame) --|   accept, or deny and close
//!   |            ... NDJSON session ...       |
//! ```
//!
//! Position defines interpretation: the frame after `Grant` is hello bytes,
//! the frame after that is reply bytes, and neither is JSON. A peer that
//! sends anything else where a message is expected is refused as malformed.
//!
//! ## Where the other role went
//!
//! The peer half — [`peer_join`], [`peer_rejoin`], the wire messages, and
//! [`JoinFrames`] itself — lives in [`crate::webrtc_join`], with no runtime
//! beneath it, so the browser can run it. It is re-exported here, and the
//! tests below still drive both ends of the real sequence against each other,
//! which is what keeps the two from drifting.
