//! The Graphshell application's identity: a user-selected Personae profile
//! loaded from the shared vault.
//!
//! Section 3 puts this here and nowhere else. `graphshell-client` stays
//! transport-independent and takes **no** Personae dependency — a client that
//! carried an identity would be a client that could only run where that
//! identity lives, which is the opposite of the portable boundary. The
//! *application* composes Personae; the protocol crates never see it.
//!
//! ## Fail closed, unlike Turnstone
//!
//! Turnstone's equivalent falls back to an unsealed profile seed when no vault
//! backend exists, because a browser refusing to start over a key store is
//! worse than one that says plainly what protects its key. **Graphshell must
//! not copy that.** It serves sessions to remote peers who pin the key they
//! reached; inventing one because the vault would not open means a peer's
//! pinned identity silently changes, which is indistinguishable from an
//! impostor. So a vault that will not open is an error here, not a fallback.
//!
//! ## Selection
//!
//! The profile is the **family choice** ([`personae::roster`]): picked once,
//! beside the shared vault, honoured by every Merely application — so
//! Graphshell speaks as whoever the user is everywhere else, rather than as a
//! second identity they did not know they had. `GRAPHSHELL_PROFILE` sits above
//! the family ladder as this application's own override, for a host that
//! genuinely should speak as someone else (a receipt run, a second resident on
//! one machine).
