//! The WebRTC door: how a browser holding an invitation becomes an admitted
//! Personae subject, and every way that does not happen.
//!
//! `browser_carrier` is the precedent. It brokers a
//! challenge-bound [`notochord::SessionHello`] for a local extension over a
//! trusted OS pipe, and the trust it leans on is the pipe: the browser had to
//! launch this process to speak to it at all. WebRTC has no such pipe. Its
//! signaling path is a relay nobody authenticated, so the door here adds the
//! two things that channel never needed:
//!
//! - **host authentication.** The host signs the link-challenge transcript,
//!   and the browser verifies that signature against the public key its
//!   invitation named *before* it trusts the channel with anything.
//! - **a redemption proof.** The invitation's capability is a secret seed the
//!   browser proves possession of, bound to that same transcript and to the
//!   ephemeral public subject it just generated. The host keeps only a
//!   verifier and a use count.
//!
//! Everything after that is the machinery that already exists. The redemption
//! mints an ordinary [`SignedDelegationCertificate`], the browser issues an
//! ordinary hello through [`crate::admission::open_session`], and the door
//! runs the ordinary [`crate::admission::admit_session`] over facts built by
//! the one audited N1 adapter. WebRTC needs no new proof grammar — only a link
//! identifier to put in the existing one, which is what
//! [`webrtc_carrier::LinkChallenge`] derives.
//!
//! ## What the host never holds
//!
//! Two secrets never exist on the host side of this module, and the signatures
//! say so rather than the prose:
//!
//! - the browser's **private subject key**. Every host-side entry point here
//!   takes a subject as `[u8; 32]` — a public key — so there is no parameter
//!   through which a private key could arrive, mistakenly or otherwise.
//! - the invitation's **redemption seed**. `issue_invite` generates it,
//!   hands it out inside the descriptor that becomes the URL fragment, and
//!   retains only [`RedemptionState`] — an Ed25519 *public* verifier plus a
//!   use count and an expiry. A host store read by an attacker therefore
//!   yields no power to mint a redemption for an invitation it holds.
//!
//! ## Signing discipline
//!
//! Nothing here signs with a bare master key. Both host signatures — the
//! invite descriptor and the challenge transcript — use one salted derived
//! keypair ([`WEBRTC_HOST_SIGNING_SALT`]) and travel with the
//! [`DerivedKeyAttestation`] that binds it to the master key, verified exactly
//! the way [`SignedDelegationCertificate`] verifies its own: the attestation
//! checks against the salt, the attested master equals the key the verifier
//! expected, and the derived public key verifies the signature. Two signatures
//! share the key because the *messages* are domain-separated in
//! `webrtc-carrier`, not because the key is.
//!
//! ## Sans-I/O
//!
//! Nothing in this module reads or writes. The host functions take bytes and
//! return bytes; the client functions are pure enough for a `wasm32` browser
//! build to call the same code the native tests do. The transport that carries
//! those bytes is `webrtc_carrier::native` on this side and
//! `webrtc_carrier::browser` on the other, and neither is named here.
