//! The browser's glue: a `BrowserInitiator` as the join's frame channel, and
//! the NDJSON session over its frames.
//!
//! Everything with a rule in it lives elsewhere and runs on an ordinary
//! `cargo test`: the join sequence in [`crate::webrtc_join`], the session
//! protocol in `graphshell_client::SessionDriver`, and the byte-to-line
//! reassembly in [`LineAssembler`]. This
//! module is what is left once those are taken out — a few dozen lines that
//! know what a data channel is, and nothing else does.
//!
//! ## Frames in, lines out
//!
//! The host presents its carrier as a byte stream and writes NDJSON to it, so
//! a line may span frames and a frame may hold several lines. The browser has
//! no pump: each inbound frame's bytes go through the assembler, and each
//! complete line reaches the driver. Outbound, a request line is cut at the
//! carrier's frame ceiling, which the host's pump reassembles the same way.
//!
//! ## Two steps, because signaling is the page's
//!
//! [`BrowserJoin::create_offer`] produces the SDP; the page carries it wherever the
//! host is and brings back the answer; [`BrowserJoin::complete`] does the
//! rest. Nothing here fetches. The one HTTP request a receipt page makes is
//! the page's own, and C5 replaces it with `mer3ly.net` without this module
//! changing.
