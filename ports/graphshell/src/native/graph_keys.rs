//! This device's membership in one personal graph's key group.
//!
//! The lane carries key agreement; this holds the secret state that reads it.
//! Session state contains long-term private keys and ratchet state, so it is
//! written only through Personae's sealed record store, never to plaintext
//! storage.
//!
//! Creating the group is an explicit act, not something a device does because
//! it noticed it could. Two devices creating independently would produce two
//! groups on one graph, each unable to read the other, and nothing on the lane
//! would say which was meant. So one device turns encryption on and adds the
//! others as their pre-keys arrive; every other device publishes a pre-key and
//! waits.
