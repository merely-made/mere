//! What a local session is, independent of who opened it.
//!
//! A browser relay and a first-party application differ in how they announce
//! themselves and in what they are then allowed to ask for. They do not differ
//! in what a session *is*: a local grant minted against this identity, a
//! closed network policy admitting exactly the projection service, and an
//! endpoint composed over the resident surface. That middle is here, so the
//! two doors cannot drift into two answers about what an admitted local client
//! holds.
