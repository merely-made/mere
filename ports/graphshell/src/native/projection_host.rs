//! K2: product endpoints served to network peers by one resident host.
//!
//! [`crate::native::browser_host`] serves a catalog route to a browser that
//! admitted itself over native messaging. This serves the same catalog to a
//! peer that dialled over a transport, which is what a place member reaching
//! the document's holder actually is.
//!
//! Everything below the accept is already built and none of it is repeated
//! here: [`crate::carrier::accept_projection_session`] decides who is admitted,
//! [`crate::native::endpoint_catalog`] decides which endpoint they reach, and
//! [`crate::session_notices`] serves and rings. What was missing was a host
//! that holds those together and outlives any one session, rather than an
//! accept loop living inside a receipt binary where nothing could consume it.
//!
//! ## Sessions are served concurrently, and that is the point
//!
//! A sequential accept loop can serve a place member. It cannot serve two,
//! which is precisely what a shared document needs: the second visitor would
//! wait at the door until the first one left. So each admitted session is
//! spawned, and the host returns to accepting immediately.
//!
//! ## Two ways in, one way to serve
//!
//! [`ResidentProjectionHost::accept_one`] admits a peer that dialled a
//! transport. [`ResidentProjectionHost::serve_admitted`] takes one somebody
//! else already admitted — the WebRTC door reaches admission over a link
//! challenge and a redemption proof this host has no opinion about, and hands
//! the conclusion over. Both run the same code after the decision, because
//! after the decision there is no difference worth having.
//!
//! Each session opens its own endpoint from the catalog, because the catalog
//! is a factory rather than a registry of live objects. Two visitors to one
//! Knot vault therefore hold two `KnotEndpoint`s over the same files, and
//! converge through the holder's own truth rather than through shared memory.
//! That is Option A working as designed: the holder is the single authority,
//! and a projection is a view of what the holder has.
