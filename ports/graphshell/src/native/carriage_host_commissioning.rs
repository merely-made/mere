//! The roster-driven passes: commissioning publish and revocation retraction.
//!
//! Two halves of one lifecycle, sharing the retraction index that links them:
//! publish writes it while the wrapping key still exists, retract consumes it
//! after revocation has deleted that key.
//!
//! The leases design ruled that "a peer that receives a revocation statement
//! destroys the certificate's leases immediately". Blinding forecloses that
//! mechanism as written: a statement names a `DelegationId`, a replica holds
//! only blinded slots, and mapping one to the other needs the device's
//! wrapping key, which a replica never has and which the wallet itself
//! deletes during revocation (`remove_remote_auth_wrapping_key`). No peer
//! can act on the statement directly, and nothing should be unblinded to
//! make it able to.
//!
//! What the ratified grammar already provides is stronger: **supersession
//! destroys**. The issuer publishes an empty record over the slot, and every
//! cooperative peer's admission prunes the superseded operation and erases
//! its payload in the same backend batch. The material is gone the moment
//! the retraction syncs, the empty shell purges at its own short expiry, and
//! a peer the retraction never reaches converges at the original lease's
//! expiry exactly as ruling 5 always guaranteed.
//!
//! The wallet must therefore remember which slots it published for a device
//! *before* revocation deletes the wrapping key. That is the retraction
//! index: a local muniment slot beside the carriage store, written at
//! publish time. Wallet-side only, which is fine, because the wallet is the
//! party that already knows every association the blinding hides from peers.
