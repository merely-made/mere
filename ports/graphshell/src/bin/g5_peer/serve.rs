//! The serving half: accept admitted sessions until the peer stops returning.
//!
//! `--revoked` folds a revocation of the peer's own grant before the loop
//! starts, so the next request it makes is refused with the reason and the
//! session ends. Mid-session revocation is not simulated here: the loop takes
//! the ledger by reference, so a revocation arriving *during* a session needs
//! a shared ledger the loop can re-read. The refusal path itself is identical
//! either way, because the check is per request rather than per connection.
