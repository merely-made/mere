//! Identity, clock, and the grant this rehearsal mints for itself.
//!
//! ## The rehearsal shortcut, stated plainly
//!
//! Both sides derive the owner keypair from `G5_OWNER`, so the connecting side
//! mints its own grant. A real deployment issues that certificate out of band
//! and the viewer never holds the owner key. What this proves is the transport,
//! admission, session-loop, and revocation path across two machines; it does
//! not prove anything about how a grant is distributed. `--revoked` stays
//! honest either way: revocation is by certificate id, so the server's refusal
//! is the same one a real owner would cause.
