//! g5_peer — the two-machine Graphshell projection rehearsal.
//!
//! G5's done-when asks for two processes on different devices to exchange
//! tickets, open a granted projection, and reject a revoked intent. Every
//! piece under that is unit-proven and none of it had crossed a real link:
//! the carrier receipts run over a `tokio` duplex or an in-process p2panda
//! pair. This is the bin that puts them on two machines.
//!
//! Modelled on `mesh-peer`, the milestone-1 two-machine rehearsal, down to the
//! ticket exchange and the environment-named identity, because that shape is
//! already proven on this LAN.
//!
//! ```text
//! g5_peer serve   [--revoked]
//! g5_peer connect --peer <ticket>
//! g5_peer connect --discover
//!
//! env:
//!   G5_OWNER    shared secret naming the owner that grants projections;
//!               both devices set the same value
//!   G5_SEED     this device's identity seed; distinct per device
//!   G5_NETWORK  shared name for the network the policy governs
//!   G5_PEER     --discover only: the *other* device's G5_SEED, from which its
//!               peer id is derived
//! ```
//!
//! [`serve`] documents the revocation arrangement, [`identity`] the shortcut
//! this rehearsal takes with the owner key, and [`connect`] what mDNS
//! discovery does and does not buy.
