//! G5d: Graphshell's projection carrier.
//!
//! The accept path that runs *before* a single `SessionOpen` byte is read. It
//! is the second of Notochord N2's two service carriers (the first is Murm's
//! real accept path), and it deliberately owns none of the machinery it uses:
//!
//! - the carrier facts come from [`transport::AcceptedSession::into_session`],
//!   the one audited adapter (N1), so this port never hand-builds a
//!   [`SessionFacts`](notochord::SessionFacts);
//! - the framing and the admitted conclusion come from
//!   [`notochord::admit_session`], so a refusal is finished rather than
//!   flushed and a refused stream cannot reach an application;
//! - the delegation grammar stays in Personae, and the owner's rules stay in
//!   the policy the host supplies.
//!
//! What is Graphshell's, and lives here: the ALPN, the service path the owner
//! offers, and which admitted actions this service serves.
//!
//! ## The transport must outlive the session
//!
//! [`accept_projection_session`] borrows its transport and never takes
//! ownership. That is load-bearing rather than stylistic. Both carriers drain
//! buffered writes when a *stream* is dropped, but by two unrelated
//! mechanisms sharing one escape hatch:
//!
//! - p2panda: quinn's `Drop for SendStream` finishes the stream, except when
//!   the connection is already errored, which is exactly what dropping the
//!   endpoint underneath it produces;
//! - Reticulum: the outbound relay reads its duplex to EOF, unless the
//!   endpoint has been torn down and the relay task aborted.
//!
//! So a short-lived accept task owning its transport would discard the reply
//! it had already written, on either arm, whenever it returned promptly.
//! Taking `&T` makes that unspellable here.
//!
//! The accept step is therefore the one part of this path that cannot move.
//! [`admit_accepted_session`] carries everything after it, for a caller that
//! already holds an accepted session and has no `&T` to borrow from.
//!
//! ## Why the action check is not a second admission
//!
//! The owner policy allows only named admission actions. Graphshell checks the
//! admitted action again through [`crate::admission::serves_action`], because
//! the service implementation remains authoritative about what it actually
//! serves even when the owner's serialized vocabulary changes.
