//! The joining side of the WebRTC door, and the wire both sides share.
//!
//! `webrtc_session` used to hold both roles. It still holds the host
//! — which needs a real carrier, a tokio pump and the resident host — but the
//! *peer* half moved here so a browser can run it. This module has no runtime
//! beneath it: no tokio, no carrier crate beyond its Wasm-clean core, no
//! transport. What it needs from its caller is exactly one thing, a
//! [`JoinFrames`] that moves bytes, and the browser's data channel is as good
//! a one as a native carrier.
//!
//! The wire messages live here too, because a message type the host encodes
//! and the peer decodes is neither side's property. The host half imports them
//! from this module rather than the other way round, so the dependency points
//! from the runtime-bound half to the runtime-free one, never back.
//!
//! ## Entropy without `rand`
//!
//! Nonces come from [`getrandom`] 0.3 directly rather than through `rand_core`.
//! Not a preference: the identity stack already carries two `getrandom` majors
//! into a wasm build, each needing its own opt-in to reach the JavaScript
//! backend, and `rand_core 0.6`'s `getrandom` feature would have added a third.
//! One more major is one more way for the browser build to fail at link time
//! with a message about a crate nobody named.
