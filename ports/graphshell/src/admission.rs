//! Graphshell's session admission: `notochord` under the Graphshell
//! action triple.
//!
//! G5c. The carrier's handshake is the **sole** admission step (G5a.1): it
//! binds a Personae subject, its attested signer, its delegation chain, the
//! requested action, and a nonce to *this* connection, and the application
//! stream is withheld until that verifies. This module supplies the two things
//! `notochord` cannot know — what Graphshell's service is called, and how
//! a Graphshell host asks — and returns the conclusion as an
//! [`AdmittedPrincipal`].
//!
//! Nothing here travels in `chirograph`. Admission happens *below*
//! the application protocol, which is why `SessionOpen` negotiates version and
//! capabilities only and carries no principal of its own.
//!
//! ## The triple
//!
//! `mere.graphshell` / `/services/projection` / `connect`. The action
//! vocabulary in `notochord` is deliberately open
//! (`RequestedAction { domain, path, action }`), so adding Graphshell is a new
//! triple rather than a change to that crate — and a delegation minted for
//! Murm's service does not admit a Graphshell session, because the scope's
//! `domain` and `path_prefix` are part of what the chain has to cover.
