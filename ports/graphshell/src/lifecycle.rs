//! G5e: what happens to a projection session after it is admitted.
//!
//! Admission is a conclusion drawn once, at connect. Authority is not: a
//! certificate expires, an owner revokes a grant, a viewer reconnects. This
//! module is the join between the two, and it introduces no new vocabulary to
//! do it. `chirograph` already models every state involved
//! ([`SessionStatus`], [`CachePolicy`], [`IntentResult::Stale`]); what was
//! missing is anything that *drives* them from the authority the carrier
//! proved.
//!
//! The dependency wall holds: `graphshell-client` and `chirograph`
//! still declare no Personae and no `notochord`. The authority lives
//! here, in the application, and reaches the client only through the mutators
//! the client already exposed.
//!
//! ## A reconnect is a new admission
//!
//! [`projection_session`] derives the session id from
//! `AdmittedPrincipal::session_id`, which is transcript-bound. A client
//! therefore cannot name the session it mounts under: reconnecting produces a
//! different id, so cached scenes from a previous admission are unreachable by
//! construction rather than by a rule someone has to enforce. Resume within
//! one admission stays exactly as G2 built it.
//!
//! ## Why the chain is retained
//!
//! [`AdmittedPrincipal`] is deliberately a conclusion and carries no claims,
//! so it cannot answer "is this still true?" later. [`AdmittedSession`]
//! retains the verified claims beside that conclusion, letting
//! [`SessionAuthority::retain_admitted`] preserve the chain for expiry and
//! revocation checks without decoding application bytes a second time.
