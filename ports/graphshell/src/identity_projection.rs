//! Castellan's identity cards and intents, at their pre-founding path.
//!
//! Moved home to [`castellan::projection`] with the keeper founding
//! (2026-08-14), and the intents took the port's own namespace the same day:
//! `graphshell.identity.*` became `castellan.*`, matching how `knot.*` already
//! names knot's. Receipts written before that carry the old strings, which is
//! correct — they record what ran.
//!
//! Since the dramatis repo plan's DR-A (2026-10-09) the intent names and
//! payloads live in `dramatis::intents`; the cards stay in castellan, which
//! re-exports both.
