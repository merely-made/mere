"""Apply the house MPL-2.0 header (shape C) to owned source files.

Carries the 2026-08-22 license ruling into a repository's sources. See
design_docs/2026-08-22_license_posture_brief.md for the ruling and
design_docs/mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-08-22_license_sweep_plan.md
for the process; invariants 1-3 are implemented here.

Provenance before license: a file receives Exhibit A only if Mark wrote it.
Paths listed in the repository's LICENSES.md are skipped entirely.

Modes:
  --dry-run   list files that would change, and why
  --apply     write the changes
  --audit     counts per repository (manifests by license, unheaded owned
              sources, Exhibit B hits, LICENSE files present)

Line endings are preserved per file. Rerunning --apply is a no-op.
