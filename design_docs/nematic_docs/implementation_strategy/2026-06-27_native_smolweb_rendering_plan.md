# Native Smolweb Rendering Plan — each format idiomatic, on genet views

**Date**: 2026-06-27
**Status**: planning (with Mark). Net-new architecture; greenfield on the genet
side (no existing smolweb render in genet or pelt, code-verified).

> **Home refinement, 2026-08-03**: the §5 crate-home diagram predates the genet
> adoption of errand/nematic and the smolweb workspace. Crate homes now read
> through the
> smolweb home decision (`smolweb/design_docs/technical_architecture/2026-08-03_smolweb_home_decision.md`):
> spec-accurate wire + grammar implementations extract to the smolweb
> workspace; enrichment and rendering stay in genet or cambium-nematic.
> Consumer references to pelt/meerkat read as Turnstone/mere hosts.

**Thesis**: render every smolweb format natively and idiomatically, the way
[Lagrange](https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/) (gemtext typesetter, SDL) and
[Geopard](https://github.com/ranfdev/Geopard) (gemtext into GTK/adwaita widgets)
do, rather than flattening everything into one document model first. Lower a
format into the gemtext view only where the line model genuinely fits; give the
rest their own view. `Block` stops being the universal renderer and keeps
the two jobs it is actually good at: knot **capture** and uniform **cards**.

**Relation to the djot plan**: this is the smolweb half of the same conclusion the
djot editor plan (`mere/design_docs/archive_docs/2026-08-06_completed_plans/2026-06-24_djot_editor_knot_nodes_plan.md`)
reached for notes (its 2026-06-27 reframe): build the view tree directly as
`xilem_serval` views, no serialize-to-HTML round-trip, source-as-truth for edit.
The djot reframe renders `EngineDocument` → `xilem_serval` views → `ScriptedDom`
→ genet-layout → netrender. This plan renders the smolweb AST → `xilem_serval`
views through the same tail. Same render target, different native intermediate.

---

## 1. The two-family model

Both families end at `xilem_serval` views, painted by genet-layout + netrender,
the same path the host chrome and the djot note tile already use every frame. They
differ only in their native intermediate model, and that difference is what decides
where the code lives and whether pelt can share it.

| Family | Native model | Renderer | Lives in | Shared with pelt? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Document** (djot/knot, markdown, reader-HTML) | `Block` | one block→view mapper | mere | no (imports `Block`) |
| **Smolweb** (gemtext, gopher, feed, scroll, misfin) | per-format AST | per-format native views | genet | yes (avoids `Block`) |

The smolweb views are genet-resident and shared with pelt *because* they avoid
`Block`. The djot/markdown mapper is mere-resident *because* it embraces
`Block`. That single line is what keeps pelt able to render the smolweb
half without dragging in the mere graph kernel (the original spin-out problem:
`nematic → inker → kernel → forme`).

### Where each format lands

**Lower into `gemtext_view`** (the line model fits cleanly):

- **nex** — directory links + text.
- **finger** — plain profile text (or a trivial text view).
- **spartan** — body is `text/gemini`; add the `=:` prompt-upload as an input-link affordance.
- **guppy** — gemtext body; only the transport differs (errand's UDP path).

**Own native view** (gemtext lowering loses the point):

- **gopher** — `gopher_view`: item-type-aware menu (icon per type: text/dir/search/image/binary/telnet), inline search prompt for type 7. Type-0 text files fall back to a plain/pre view.
- **feed (RSS/Atom)** — `feed_view`: a subscription / article-list idiom (entry cards, dates, source), not a wall of links. Detail in §3.
- **scroll** — `scroll_view`: gemtext body plus Scroll's ring-nav chrome (prev / next / up, author/metadata).
- **misfin** — `message_view`: gemini-based mail, so a message idiom, not a document.

**Out of scope here**: titan (a write/upload action, no render), markdown and djot
(document family, §2), HTML (genet proper), live web (scry surface frames).

---

## 2. Markdown rides the djot mapper (no new view)

Markdown is the format that proves the document family: it does not get a bespoke
view, because `Block` is already markdown-shaped. It collapses into the
djot mapper.

```rust
// in mere (the mapper imports Block, so it is host-coupled by design)
fn markdown_tile(bytes: &[u8]) -> impl SerView {
    let doc = nematic::markdown::parse(bytes);   // pulldown-cmark today; jotdown after migration
    block_to_view(&doc)                          // THE SAME mapper djot/knot uses
}
```

`markdown::parse` and `djot::parse` both produce `Block`, so they share one
mapper. Markdown's inline richness (emphasis, inline code, links inside prose,
nested lists) is handled by the mapper's `InlineSpan` rendering, which gemtext's
flat line model never needed. That is the real reason gemtext earns its own view
and markdown does not: gemtext has no inline cascade, markdown does, and the mapper
already speaks inline.

**Prerequisite — `Block::Table`**: the block enum
([crates/inker/inker/src/document.rs](../../../crates/inker/inker/src/document.rs)) has no
table variant (Heading/Paragraph/CodeBlock/Quote/List/Image/Preformatted/Rule/
Feed\*/MetadataRow/Badge/Link/breaks). Both djot and markdown have tables, and both
ride the same mapper, so `Block::Table` is a shared prerequisite of the
whole document family, not a sub-step of either consumer. Adding the variant
touches the mapper, the round-trip exporters
([render.rs](../../../crates/inker/inker/src/document/render.rs) /
[render/export.rs](../../../crates/inker/inker/src/document/render/export.rs)), and every
exhaustive match on `Block`, so it lands as its own change **before** either
the djot note tile or the markdown tile renders. Owned by the djot plan;
sequenced ahead of its mapper here as the Table prerequisite.

---

## 3. The feed view (genuinely bespoke)

Feed is unique the other way from markdown: it refuses the document model. A feed
is a subscription of entries, not a body of blocks.

```rust
// in genet/smolweb-views (imports errand/parse + xilem_serval; NO Block)
pub fn feed_view(feed: &Feed, theme: &Palette) -> impl SerView {
    flex_col((
        feed_header(feed, theme),     // title, site link, description, unread count, Subscribe action
        flex_col(feed.entries.iter().map(|e| feed_entry_card(e, theme))),
    ))
}

fn feed_entry_card(e: &Entry, theme: &Palette) -> impl SerView {
    focusable(flex_col((
        row((title_link(&e.title, &e.url), relative_date(e.published))),
        e.summary.as_deref().map(|s| summary_snippet(s, theme)),
        source_badge(&e.source),
    )))
    .on_action(|cx| cx.navigate(&e.url))   // opening an entry fetches + renders its own format
}
```

What makes feed its own thing:

- **It is a list, not a document.** Entry cards with title-as-link, relative date, summary snippet, source badge. Arrowable rows, the reader feel, not a flat stack of link lines.
- **Subscribe is an action, not a render.** A feed is the one smolweb surface you do not just read, you subscribe to. The header's Subscribe button does a real thing: add the feed to a subscription store and poll it, with genuine state (last-fetched, new-since). Backed by a real refresh, never a placebo spinner.
- **It straddles web and smolweb.** RSS/Atom arrive over http(s) too. `feed_view` is scoped to structured RSS/Atom (smolweb-parse's `quick-xml` feed parser). The gemtext "gemfeed" convention (date-prefixed link lines) is just gemtext, so it renders through `gemtext_view`; feed-detection there is a separate concern.
- **Opening an entry recurses into the family.** The entry URL may be gemini, http, or gopher, so `navigate` hands off to whichever view that scheme resolves to. Feed is a hub into the other renderers.

---

## 4. The gemtext view (the family base)

```rust
// in genet/smolweb-views (depends on xilem-serval + errand/parse + tinct)
pub fn gemtext_view(doc: &Gemtext, theme: &Palette) -> impl SerView {
    flex_col(doc.lines.iter().map(|line| match line {
        GemLine::Heading { level, text } => heading(*level, text, theme),
        GemLine::Text(t)                 => paragraph(t, theme),
        GemLine::Link { url, label }     => focusable(link_line(url, label, theme))
                                              .on_action(|cx| cx.navigate(url)),
        GemLine::Item(t)                 => list_item(t, theme),
        GemLine::Quote(t)                => blockquote(t, theme),
        GemLine::Pre { alt, text }       => preformatted(alt, text, theme),
    }))
}
```

The link line is the whole reason to go native: a `focusable` genet widget with
its own hover/focus/visited styling and a navigate action, the way Geopard makes
every link a row you arrow through. illume can run its entity pass inside paragraph
text (URLs, mentions lighting up), so prose gets the same treatment as the rest of
the host.

This mirrors the illume pattern Mark already ships
(illume plan (`mere/design_docs/mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-06-26_illume_text_lexer_plan.md`)):
portable core + tinct palette + genet renderer + host bridge. Smolweb is the same
four tiers — errand transport (source), errand/parse (parse), tinct (palette),
genet views (render) — with the host picking the view.

---

## 5. Crate homes and dependency direction (the one rule)

```text
errand  (sibling crate, crates.io-shaped: the smolweb crate)
   ├── transport (default)       bytes in/out  ──► pelt fetch, meerkat, murm/misfin
   └── parse (feature)           bytes -> per-format AST
         ├── genet/smolweb-views  (gemtext / gopher / feed / scroll / misfin views)
         │       └── consumed by BOTH pelt and mere (no Block, so portable)
         └── mere/nematic          (AST -> Block: capture + cards only)

inker Block
   └── mere block->view mapper  (djot / markdown / reader-HTML)
           └── consumed by mere only (imports Block, host-coupled by design)
```

Nothing in genet depends on mere. nematic shrinks from "owns parse-and-render" to
a lowering (AST → Block) on the capture path.

**Why parse folds into errand (not a separate sibling).** errand already encodes
each protocol's transport structure; the parse is the document structure of the
same protocols, so they evolve in lockstep (add a protocol, add both) — exactly the
two-repos-in-lockstep friction the bundle-when-lockstep rule avoids. Transport and
parse are almost always paired (fetch a capsule, then render it), so one dep gives a
forker "everything smolweb, host-agnostic." The `parse` feature keeps transport pure
(murm/misfin/meerkat stay on a parser-free default; `quick-xml` rides the gate for
feeds only; gemtext/gopher/nex need no new deps). genet/smolweb-views depending on
`errand` with the parse feature is the same public sibling pelt already pulls for
transport, so the one-way direction holds.

**Markdown stays home.** CommonMark is not smolweb, so it does not join errand. Its
portable parse is essentially `pulldown-cmark` already; only the `Block`
lowering is mere-specific, so it stays in nematic. There is no markdown crate to
spin out.

### Block's settled role

It stops being the universal renderer and keeps two jobs:

- **Capture**: clip from any native view → lower into `Block` → store in a knot. The smolweb AST feeds both the native view and this lowering, so they never diverge.
- **Cards / previews / orrery nodes**: uniform thumbnails across formats, where a capsule, an article, and a note should look alike.

Focused viewing goes native. Cards and clips stay `Block`. Per-surface, not
all-or-nothing.

---

## Findings (2026-06-27, verified against code)

- **nematic cannot spin out as-is.** `nematic/Cargo.toml` has `inker.workspace = true`; every engine file imports `inker::{Engine, Block, EngineRegistry, routing}`. Cone: `nematic → inker → kernel (graph-kernel) → forme, node-lineage, petgraph, rkyv, accesskit`. Spinning it out would invert the one-way rule (mere consumes genet, not the reverse).
- **`Block` is not a smolweb model.** inker has two dispatch paths ([surface_engine.rs](../../../crates/inker/inker/src/surface_engine.rs) comment): document registry for `nematic.*` *and* `genet.web`; surface registry for `scrying.web`. Static HTML maps into `Block` too. It is mere's universal semantic-document model, the knot/reader/card substrate.
- **`Block` is the live render model today.** `platen/document_scene.rs` paints blocks; `meerkat/card`, `gloss`, `forme/uxtree` consume them. `inker/src/document/render.rs` + `render/export.rs` round-trip blocks back to markdown / gemtext / gophermap / knot (capture path).
- **errand is already the shared transport** (sibling repo, crates.io-shaped, deps `url`/`tokio`/`rustls`/`ring`). Consumed by `meerkat`, `murm/misfin`. Genet has zero references to it.
- **pelt's fetch seam exists and is documented for this.** `pelt-core::ResourceFetcher` (`fn fetch(&url) -> Option<Vec<u8>>`); `LocalFetcher` dispatches by scheme (data / http(s) via netfetcher / file). errand slots in as a smolweb-scheme branch.
- **genet is the shared render layer.** xilem-serval is the Xilem view layer over genet (`html_qual`, `focusable`, `styled_field`, `text`); the illume plan already renders through `xilem_serval::styled_textarea`. So native smolweb views on genet primitives serve pelt and mere alike.
- **Greenfield.** No `gemtext`/`gopher`/`smolweb` render exists in genet/components or genet/ports.

---

## Phases

Built so each phase stands alone and the early ones are genet-local and small.

- **A — pelt → errand (transport). Done 2026-06-27.** `errand` added to `pelt-desktop` behind a `smolweb` feature (requires `tile-surface`, mirroring `netfetch`); `smolweb_get_bytes` beside `http_get_bytes` reusing the existing `runtime().block_on` bridge; `LocalFetcher::fetch` branches on `errand::Scheme::parse` for gemini/gopher/nex/finger/spartan/guppy. The reference shell installs an `InMemoryTofu` once so gemini pins persist for the process (a mismatch fails the load rather than silently re-pinning). Verified: `smolweb` and `netfetch` features both compile, 35 pelt-desktop tests pass incl. the smolweb routing test (`.invalid`-host → clean `None`).
- **B — errand gains `parse` (mostly done 2026-06-27).** Fold the smolweb parsers into errand. **Design correction**: the parse module is **always compiled** (the dep-free parsers cost ~nothing for transport-only consumers); only the feed parser, which needs `quick-xml`, sits behind a `parse-feed` feature. The original "whole `parse` feature" gate could not be resolved cross-repo — cargo does feature resolution against the *locked GitHub* errand (which lacks the new feature), and a `.cargo/config.toml` `paths` override only swaps source at *build* time, not features. An always-on module sidesteps this; `parse-feed` will still need errand pushed once a mere/genet consumer enables it. nematic keeps the `Engine` impls as `ast → Block` lowerings; `knot/expand.rs` and genet/smolweb-views consume the same module. **Done**: `errand::parse::{gemtext, gopher, nex}` (line-level / typed-item / directory-entry ASTs) + nematic's `GemtextEngine` / `GopherEngine` / `NexEngine` lowerings. gemtext transitively moved guppy/scroll/spartan/misfin/titan too (they delegate to `GemtextEngine`); finger delegates to `TextEngine` (no own parser, nothing to extract). So **every smolweb format except feed now parses through errand**. Verified: 21 errand parser tests + the full nematic suite (157 lib + 3 example tests, 0 failures). ~~**Remaining**: feed (525 LOC) behind a `parse-feed` feature, deferred.~~ **Stale — superseded by the landed state (see Progress 2026-06-27)**: the feed parser shipped as `errand::parse::feed` with `quick-xml` as an **unconditional** light dep (no `parse-feed` gate; the cross-repo feature wall made a gate impractical, and quick-xml is small next to the rustls/tokio cone), nematic's `FeedEngine` was rewired onto it (JSON Feed stays nematic-local), and errand's stale gate comment was cleaned. **Phase B is fully done.**
- **C — genet/smolweb-views (in progress).** New genet component (`components/smolweb-views` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->, depends on xilem-serval + errand). **Done 2026-06-27**: `gemtext_view` — native element tree (`div.gemtext` of `h1`–`h3` / `p` / focusable `a` link lines / grouped `ul`/`li` / `blockquote` / `pre`), links are `clickable`s carrying `href` and emitting an `on_navigate(url)` action (`Action: xilem_serval::Action`); plus `theme::{SmolwebTheme, stylesheet}` — **per-site palette by default** (host hashed to a hue, the Lagrange look), overridable with Plain/Light/Dark/App/System. Returns a boxed `SmolwebView` (the `chrome.rs` `*View` pattern, so the view doesn't capture the input lifetime). Verified: 5 crate tests (element-tree structure, link href, per-site hue stability, presets). **Done 2026-06-27 (cont.)**: `gopher_view` (info runs fold to one `pre`, resources are type-marked `data-kind` focusable links) and `feed_view` (article-list reader: title + `article.feed-entry` cards, linked titles). Theming extended to gopher + feed classes. 7 crate tests pass. **Remaining for Phase C**: **pelt wiring**. Note the render path: pelt has a static-HTML path (`LoadedDocument` → `StaticDocument` → `IncrementalLayout` → `scene_from_session_dom`) and a **ScriptedDom** path (chrome/scripted, via `GenetAppRunner`). The smolweb views build a `ScriptedDom`, so they plug into the *second* path — a new smolweb document type in pelt (fetch via errand → parse → build view → `ScriptedDom` → layout → scene → present), applying `stylesheet(theme, url)`, routing the `on_navigate` action to a load, plus scroll/click. Done condition: `pelt gemini://…` renders a native, arrowable, themed page.
- **Table (prerequisite, djot-plan-owned) — DONE** (mere `1b29cda`, 2026-06-27). `Block::Table` (header + rows of inline-span cells + per-column `TableAlignment`), its mapper case (`note_view` → `<table>`), the round-trip exporters (markdown / djot pipe tables, text / gemini / gopher fallbacks), and every exhaustive `Block` match across the workspace; `cargo check --workspace` green. The parser side (jotdown / pulldown table events → `Table`) lands with the live tiles.
- **D — block→view mapper (document family).** The djot plan owns this (its slice 1). markdown rides it (the `markdown_tile` of §2) rather than growing a bespoke view; reader-mode HTML rides it too.

---

## Progress

- **2026-06-27**: Plan created from the nematic-spin-out conversation with Mark. Resolved the product question (native + idiomatic per format, lower into gemtext only where clean). Architecture verified against the live tree (Findings above).
- **2026-06-27**: Phase A landed in genet (`ports/pelt-desktop` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->): `smolweb` feature, `smolweb_get_bytes`, `LocalFetcher` scheme branch, one-time `InMemoryTofu` install, offline smolweb test. `smolweb` + `netfetch` both compile; 35 tests pass. Notes: (1) errand on GitHub `main` (439b729d) is current with the local checkout, so the graph resolves without the path override, but `errand` was added to genet's gitignored `.cargo/config.toml` `paths` for the Phase B local-edit loop. (2) `Block::Table` confirmed landed (`inker/src/document.rs`), unblocking the Phase D document-family mapper.
- **2026-06-27**: Phase B gemtext slice. Added `errand::parse` (always-on module, `src/parse/{mod,gemtext}.rs`) with a line-level `GemLine` AST + 8 unit tests; rewrote nematic's `GemtextEngine` to `parse → lower` against it (the grouping into `Block` stays in nematic, the line grammar moves to errand). Added `errand` to mere's gitignored `.cargo/config.toml` `paths`. **Cross-repo learning**: a locally-added cargo *feature* is invisible to a dependent repo (feature resolution uses the locked GitHub manifest; the path override only swaps source at build) — hence the always-on-module design; adding a new gated feature to a sibling needs a push. All 22 nematic gemtext-path tests pass (gemtext + the delegating guppy/scroll/spartan/misfin/titan + knot fence expansion).
- **2026-06-27**: Phase B gopher + nex slices. Added `errand::parse::gopher` (typed `GopherItem`/`GopherKind` with RFC-4266 URL synthesis) and `errand::parse::nex` (`NexEntry` directory detection + `base_url` resolution); rewrote nematic's `GopherEngine` and `NexEngine` to lower against them (info/error folding and link-list building stay in nematic). Confirmed **finger has no own parser** (wraps `TextEngine`), so no work needed. Verified: 21 errand parser tests + full nematic suite (157 lib + 3 example, 0 failures). Phase B is complete except **feed**, which is deferred pending an errand push (the `parse-feed`/`quick-xml` gate is the cross-repo-feature case).
- **2026-06-27**: Committed. errand gemtext = `8381620` (pushed by Mark); errand gopher+nex = `3ce107f` (committed, awaiting Mark's push); mere nematic lowering + this plan = `7845fee`. genet Phase A left uncommitted (its tree carries unrelated `genet-winit-host` + a deleted wpt fixture; not bundled blind). **Phase C readiness** (xilem_serval API confirmed for the native views): build element views with `tags::*` (`div`/`p`/`a`/`h1`-`h3`/`ul`/`li`, plus `el("pre",…)`/`el("blockquote",…)`) + `text`; heterogeneous line lists use `Vec<Box<dyn AnyView<State, (), GenetCtx, GenetElement>>>` (the `chrome.rs`/`tile_surface.rs` pattern); links carry `href` and ride pelt's existing link resolution (no bespoke click wiring for v1); tested via `GenetAppRunner::new(dom, |s| view, s)` against the resulting `ScriptedDom`. Open design calls for Phase C: link→navigate action vs href-only, and tinct-driven gemtext styling (its own typographic identity). Next: scaffold `components/smolweb-views` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> + `gemtext_view`, then `gopher_view`; wire into pelt; feed (`feed_view` + errand `parse-feed`) last.
- **2026-06-27**: Phase C slice 1. Created `genet/components/smolweb-views` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> with `gemtext_view` (native element tree, focusable `on_navigate` links, gemtext grouping) + `theme` (per-site default palette à la Lagrange, with Plain/Light/Dark/App/System overrides). on_navigate chosen over href-only (links emit a host action; href kept too). Two xilem gotchas resolved: the click handler's return needs `Action: xilem_serval::Action`; and the view is returned as a boxed `SmolwebView` (not `impl Trait`) so it doesn't capture the `&[GemLine]` lifetime. 5 tests pass. genet now holds Phase A + this crate, uncommitted (alongside unrelated `genet-winit-host`/wpt changes). Next: `gopher_view`, then pelt wiring (apply `stylesheet`, route navigate), then feed.
- **2026-06-27**: Phase C pelt wiring (core). Added `pelt-desktop::SmolwebDocument` (the smolweb twin of `Chrome`): `load`/`parse` → `detect` (scheme + feed sniff) → errand parse → `gemtext_view`/`gopher_view`/`feed_view` → `GenetAppRunner` `ScriptedDom`, `frame(w,h)` via `scene_from_scripted_dom` over `STRUCTURAL_SHEET` + `stylesheet(theme,url)`, and `click_at` → `hit_test` + `dispatch_click` returning the `on_navigate` URL. So **transport → parse → native themed render → scene → click-to-navigate works end to end, GPU-free**. 4 pelt tests pass (renders glyphs for gemtext/gopher/feed; link click resolves to its URL). Dropped nematic's now-dead `quick-xml`; fixed errand's stale `parse-feed` gate comment. **Windowed viewer done 2026-06-27**: `SmolwebDocument` impls the static viewer's generic `ViewerContent` trait (so it reuses the existing winit shell — no new viewer code), `run_smolweb_viewer` opens the window, and pelt's CLI routes smolweb schemes to it (`pelt --features smolweb --engine static gemini://…`). Per-site theme by default. Verified: `pelt --engine static gemini://geminiprotocol.net/` fetches the live capsule, renders it natively, and runs the window loop (exit 124 at a 12s timeout; no fetch/GPU error) — the full path works on screen. **Phase C complete.** **Post-C polish (2026-06-27)**: the smolweb viewer now **scrolls** — `SmolwebDocument` retains an `IncrementalLayout` session (built lazily, rebuilt on resize) and scrolls it via `scroll_by`/`scroll_at`/`scroll_for_key` over `scene_from_session_dom`, the `ViewerContent` impl delegating wheel + key scroll to it (verified: a tall capsule scrolls, top clamps). **Link navigation done (2026-06-27)**: `chrome_viewer`'s `BrowserApp` is now generic over a `BrowsableContent` trait (`load`/`frame`/`scroll`/`click→ContentClick`); `LoadedDocument` and `SmolwebDocument` both implement it, so the smolweb capsule hosts in the **same chrome shell** (omnibar + back/forward + history) the HTML browser uses. A link click resolves to its URL → `resolve_href` → `chrome.navigate_to` → reload; `run_smolweb_browser` is the entry, and the pelt CLI routes smolweb schemes to it. Verified: `pelt --features smolweb --engine static gemini://…` launches the chrome browser over the live capsule (interactive click-nav is the one piece left to eyeball). **App theme done (2026-06-28)**: `SmolwebTheme::App(SmolwebPalette)` now carries a host-supplied palette (the `SmolwebPalette` struct is public), so a host (mere/meerkat) can map its tinct theme onto smolweb pages instead of falling back to Plain — the configurability seam. `System` is documented as host-resolved to light/dark. Pelt still uses the `Site` default (it has no app theme to pass); the capability is ready for when the Mere host renders these views. **JSON Feed: deliberately not in the smolweb path** — JSON Feed is an HTTP-web format, near-nonexistent over smolweb, and putting it in errand would pull serde into the transport crate's cone for ~no smolweb traffic; nematic keeps its JSON path for the http/knot context. **The native smolweb rendering effort is complete**: transport → parse → native themed render → scene → window, with scroll, link navigation (shared chrome browser), per-site + preset + app theming. Genuinely remaining is only host integration (Mere rendering the views, driving `App`/`System`) and interactive eyeballing. **2026-06-27 (earlier)**: Phase C slices 2-3 + feed extraction. Added `gopher_view` + `feed_view` to smolweb-views (7 tests). Extracted the RSS/Atom XML parser into `errand::parse::feed` (`Feed`/`FeedEntry` AST + `strip_html_tags`, quick-xml as an unconditional light errand dep — the cross-repo feature wall again) and **rewired nematic's `FeedEngine` onto it** (JSON Feed stays nematic-local via serde; both flavours build errand's `Feed`); 23 nematic feed tests pass, so every smolweb format now parses through errand. **Uncommitted, needs another errand push**: errand feed parser (`3ce107f`'s successor), nematic feed rewire, smolweb-views gopher/feed. `quick-xml` may now be unused in nematic (left in per the ask-before-dropping rule). **Stopped before pelt wiring** (deliberately): it's a ScriptedDom-path integration deserving a focused turn (see Phase C remaining). nematic FeedEngine still declares `quick-xml`; confirm before dropping.

## Cross-references

- [smolweb fidelity plan](2026-07-01_smolweb_fidelity_plan.md) — the successor that tracks this plan's spec-faithfulness gaps: enrich the parse ASTs (the losses are at parse time, not paint time), trust in the native lane (the genet lane drops the `DocumentTrustState` the card lane carries), and bespoke (regime B) rendering only where a format's line model is genuinely not box-shaped, gopher first. The A/B/C regime frame and the code-verified collapse inventory live there.
- djot editor + knot nodes plan (`mere/design_docs/archive_docs/2026-08-06_completed_plans/2026-06-24_djot_editor_knot_nodes_plan.md`) — owns the document-family block→view mapper (Phase D); its 2026-06-27 reframe set the direct-to-genet-views render path this plan shares.
- illume text lexer plan (`mere/design_docs/mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-06-26_illume_text_lexer_plan.md`) — the portable-core + tinct + genet-renderer + host-bridge pattern this mirrors; the entity pass reused inside gemtext prose.
- [polyglot knot design](2026-05-08_polyglot_knot_design.md) — the knot format the capture path lowers into; `knot/expand.rs` shares the smolweb parse functions.
- knot evaluation + export plan (`genet/design_docs/archive_docs/2026-09-02/2026-06-12_knot_evaluation_export_plan.md`) — the `to_gemtext` / gophermap exporters on the capture/round-trip side of `Block`.
- errand (sibling repo `mark-ik/errand`) — the shared smolweb transport Phase A wires into pelt.
