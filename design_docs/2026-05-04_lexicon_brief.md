# Mere Lexicon Brief

**Status**: Active / authoritative for terms covered
**Date**: 2026-05-04
**Scope**: Establishes the post-rename naming scheme and in-product vocabulary for the Mere project. Authoritative for terms it covers; supersedes the prior [2026-05-03 lexicon brief](../../graphshell/design_docs/2026-05-03_lexicon_brief.md) *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-link --> (which had Strophos+Orrery as the product) and complements [`TERMINOLOGY.md`](TERMINOLOGY.md) until that file is fully populated. Terms not addressed here are covered by the donor harvest indexes; the donor `graphshell` repo is GitHub-archived (read-only) and its local clone was deleted 2026-05-27, so `../../graphshell/design_docs/` paths no longer resolve.

**Execution status (updated 2026-06-09)**: the workspace has since reorganized from the flat 2026-05-04 scaffolding into supercrate subtrees under `crates/`, with **meerkat** as the host on the genet-as-host path; see the topology table in [`DOC_README.md`](DOC_README.md) for the current layout. The donor `graphshell` repo was GitHub-archived and its local clone deleted 2026-05-27.

**Graphshell amendment (2026-07-22):** the old Graphshell browser product remains
retired into Mere. The name is reclaimed for a distinct Merely-family product:
the remote projection host over Scenograph, specified in the
[Graphshell remote projection host plan](mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-07-22_graphshell_remote_projection_host_plan.md).
Mere's internal chrome is simply its `shell` crate family and does not carry the
Graphshell product name.

**Vocabulary amendment (2026-08-31):** [`TERMINOLOGY.md`](TERMINOLOGY.md) is
authoritative for the implemented migration. **Engram** became **Codicil**;
the former generic `codicil::Codicil<T>` log became
`muniment::Journal<T>`; **Tessera** became **Standing**; lower-case *flora* as
a Moot's accumulated corpus is retired because **FLORA** means federated LoRA;
the former memorial meaning of **Tulpa** became **Hagiograph**; and **Tulpa**
now names Gemot's community-recognized collective artifact and identity,
supplanting the proposed *egregore* role. Older rows below are retained as the
dated decision trail, not current vocabulary.

## 1. Top-level naming

| Name | What it labels | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| **Mere** | Product / app — the browser itself | Triple-meaning positioning: *merely* (humble — "merely a browser!"), *mere* (a small lake — still-water surface where things accrue and reflect), slant-rhyme with *mirror*. Disambiguates from Māori weapon by intentional framing. Replaces *Graphshell-as-product-name* and *Verse-as-network-layer*. |
| **Merely** | Parent brand / company-name layer | Adopted 2026-07-09, replacing *Strophos*; confirmed 2026-07-10 after a full challenge round (history entry 4). The umbrella takes its name from the product's own positioning: Mere is *merely a browser*, so the parent is that adverb. Humility as a house style. GitHub org: **merely-made** (registered 2026-07-10; bare `merely` was taken). |
| **Verso** | Brand-level concept name for the rendering-surface layer | Crate family is `verso` (`verso-core`, `tile-state`). |

## 2. The printing-press metaphor

The architectural through-line. Engines (Wry, Genet, Nematic) produce content. The **inker** pairs each engine to its content. The **platen** composes the layout (graph-aware). The **verso** layer receives the impression (places it into tile slots). The user sees the printed result via **meerkat** (the host), chrome and content both rendered by genet on the genet-as-host path. **Eidetic** keeps the impressions over time. **Murm** carries bilateral comms; **moothold** carries federation across moots; **coalition** (t4) carries coalition across mootholds.

## 3. Workspace crates

All scaffolded at `<workspace>\repos\mere\crates\`. Reserved on crates.io as `0.0.1`. **(2026-05-04 snapshot; the workspace has since reorganized into supercrate subtrees with `meerkat` as host. See the [`DOC_README.md`](DOC_README.md) topology table for the current layout.)**

| Crate | Role |
|-------|------|
| **`mere`** | Product crate — entrypoint composing everything else |
| **`graphshell`** | Reclaimed 2026-07-22 for the remote projection host application/facade. Mere's chrome remains in its own `shell` crates. |
| **`verso`** | Tile-rendering-surface management (`verso-core`, `tile-state`) |
| **`inker`** | Engine controller — selects/orchestrates engines |
| **`platen`** | Graph-aware composition surface (the press to verso's page) |
| **`nematic`** | Smolweb engine — Gemini, Gopher, HTML, Markdown, RSS/Atom |
| **`murm`** | Bilateral peer-to-peer comms supercrate |
| **`murmuring`** | Inner protocol-core for bilateral chat-protocol selection (within `murm`) |
| **`moothold`** | Federation of moots (Tier 3). The crate hosts t1–t3 logic; t4 gemot logic homes in the sibling `gemot` crate (claimed on crates.io 2026-07-14, 0.1.0: assembly layer for Moot lifecycle, governance, replication, and Tessera). (Will switch to `moot` if that crate name frees up.) |
| **`mooting`** | Inner protocol-core for moot internal coordination + thin protocol-client orchestration (within `moothold`) |
| **`eidetic`** | Private local memory crate — owner-scoped blob storage substrate the orrery (Tier 1) lives on |

**Gerund-crate convention:** `murmuring` and `mooting` (gerunds) name the inner protocol-core layers. The singulars *murmur* and *moot* fall out as user-facing terms. Top-level supercrates (`murm`, `moothold`) avoid gerund forms.

## 4. In-product lexicon

### 4.1 The tier framework (revised 2026-05-07)

Mere's social-graph structures form a four-tier scale. Full design in
[`mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-05-07_moot_tiers_and_voluntary_hosting_brief.md`](mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-05-07_moot_tiers_and_voluntary_hosting_brief.md).

| Tier | Term | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **T1** | **mere** | A single user's root dataspace, *their root mere*, pre-social: it founds a moot the moment it is shared. Backed by `eidetic`. (Was **orrery** until 2026-07-26. The moot-of-one slogan *"Your mere is your moot"* superseded 2026-07-30 by *"a moot is when your mere is shared"*; see §4.2.) |
| **T2** | **moot** | A persistent themed federatable graph-view community. Members pin and govern. Dissolves if nobody pins. |
| **T3** | **moothold** | A federation of moots — *a holding of moots*, in the Anglo-Saxon sense (cf. household, stronghold, freehold). ILL-shaped reciprocity between member moots. |
| **T4** | **gemot** | A sovereign assembly of mootholds. Provides organizing defaults; per-moothold override + clean fork-out always possible. (Was **coalition** until 2026-07-30; see §4.2.) |

All four tiers are **forkable**.

### 4.2 Terms

| Term | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **mere** *(count noun)* | **A configurable spatial dataspace.** The unit an application integrates: Isometry's overmap, Woodshed's stage, Strophe's arrangement, Turnstone's canvas are each a mere. Many per user. The platform is named for its unit, so capital **Mere** is the platform and lowercase **a mere** is one dataspace. Ruled with Mark 2026-07-26: the concept had no name and was informally covered by *orrery* while the reference host was the only application, which is why the word stopped stretching once four products each integrated one. The word is the lake sense already carried in the product's positioning (see [`TERMINOLOGY.md`](TERMINOLOGY.md)), and it pluralizes, which *orrery* never did. Amended 2026-07-30: the tiers are escalating socialization of the mere; sharing never stops a mere being a mere. |
| **your root mere** *(t1)* | The tier-1 mere: a user's own, pre-social; it founds (or joins) a moot the moment it is shared. Replaces *orrery* at this tier; the "personal moot-of-one" phrasing superseded 2026-07-30. |
| **orrery** *(form factor)* | The cosmos-style spatial form factor — the whole knowledge-cosmos seen at once, force-directed, in-scene. A way a mere can be *rendered*, exactly as **volvelle** names the radial-moot form factor; not a tier and not a container. Narrowed from "a user's root graph view" 2026-07-26. Code that says `Scope::Orrery`, "orrery root", or "the orrery's tick" already means this and is correct as written. |
| **moot** *(t2, count noun)* | A persistent themed federatable graph-view community: what a mere becomes when shared (ruled 2026-07-30). Genesis face: a moot begins when your mere is shared. Grown face: a mature moot may govern one or more meres (the region-grafting model); a shared world never stops being a mere. Substrate rule: solo meres are born share-ready, so mootedness is a membership change, never a format migration. |
| **moothold** *(t3, count noun)* | A federation of moots — a sovereign holding (Anglo-Saxon *-hold* sense) |
| **gemot** *(t4, count noun)* | A sovereign assembly of mootholds (renamed from *coalition* 2026-07-30: OE *gemōt* is the collective form of *mōt*, so the apex tier rejoins the moot/moothold word-family where *coalition* was the Latinate outlier; *coalition* had itself renamed *demesne* 2026-06-04). Historically *gemot* named assemblies at every scale (hundredgemot, shiregemot), with the witenagemot as the famous apex; the bare/prefixed split maps onto t2/t4. crates.io `gemot` already held (0.1.0, 2026-07-14). |
| **suzerainty** *(relation)* | The relation between an outer tier and its inner members — overlordship without absorbing internal sovereignty. Applies at moothold ↔ moot and gemot ↔ moothold. |
| **volvelle** | UI form factor — a moot expanded radially in the Navigator (medieval rotating-disc knowledge instrument) |
| **astroid** | Internal UX vocab for graphlet hub-collapse: collapsing a graphlet to its central node forms an astroid-shaped boundary curve |
| **tessera** | Trust / contribution / reputation token; validated across mootholds and gemots (Roman *tessera hospitalis*). Accrues against an identity's chain root (per the substrate brief's persona-id-chain insight). |
| **engram** | Portable, durable, schematicized memory unit — the canonical contribution payload. `TransferProfile` envelope plus typed `EngramMemory` items (see inherited [`engram_spec.md`](../../graphshell/design_docs/verse_docs/implementation_strategy/engram_spec.md) *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-link -->) |
| **flora** | Accumulated body of engrams composing a moot's culture / geist |
| **eidetic** | Private local memory — owner-scoped, the substrate engrams are distilled from. *Distinct from any moot's flora.* |
| **kith / kin** | Contact tier distinction — *kith* = those known to you, *kin* = close. Orthogonal to moot membership. |
| **strophalos** *(optional)* | Evocative term for an individual user's running Mere instance ("your strophalos has 47 moots") |

## 5. Retired terms

Do not revive:

| Retired | Replacement | Why |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Graphshell** *(the old browser product brand)* | **Mere** | The old product was absorbed into Mere. The name was reclaimed 2026-07-22 for the separate remote projection host; it does not rename Mere. |
| **Strophos** *(as product brand)* | **Mere** | Strophos retained at parent-brand level only — itself retired 2026-07-09, see below |
| **Strophos** *(as parent brand)* | **Merely** | Retired 2026-07-09. The umbrella now derives from the product ("merely a browser!") rather than from a separate Greek root. Strophos survives only in this brief's history sections and in `archive_docs/`; do not reintroduce it. |
| **Lemni** / **Lemniscate** | — | Lemni Inc. (Sequoia-backed AI-agent SaaS, Class 9 mark) |
| **Verse** *(network layer)* | folded into Mere-at-network-scope | The Navigator handles networked-community as a form-factor |
| **Murmuration** *(community layer)* | **Moothold** + count noun *moot* | TESS wall (Murmuration, Inc., civic-tech) |
| **Gist** *(contribution unit)* | **Engram** | Already canonical and richer |
| **Flock** *(contact grouping)* | **Kith / Kin** | More nuanced relational tiering |
| **Mootcore** | **Moothold** | Renamed within naming conversation |
| **Middlenet** | **Nematic** | Better metaphor (aligned-but-flowing threads, like nematic liquid crystals) |
| **Verso** *(as engine-controller)* | split: **verso-tile** (rendering) + **inker** (engine control) | Two distinct architectural concerns |
| **Astroid** *(as product brand)* | preserved as internal UX vocab | Asteroid-confusion problem at brand level |
| **Orrery** *(as product brand)* | preserved as internal term of art | crates.io collision + namespace dilution at brand level |

## 6. Naming history

*Statements in this section are historical and are deliberately **not** rewritten
when a name changes; the retired-terms table above carries the current mapping.*

The product name went through several commits during the 2026-05-03 / 2026-05-04 sessions:

1. **Strophos** (parent) + **Orrery** (product) — initial commit, Orrery rejected when user found it weak as a product brand
2. **Mere** — final commit. Replaces Strophos+Orrery as product brand. Strophos retained at parent-brand level. Orrery preserved as internal term of art for the root graph view.

Then, on 2026-07-09:

3. **Merely** (parent). Strophos retired at the parent level too, and the umbrella
   is taken from the product instead of standing beside it: Mere is *merely a
   browser*, so the family is Merely. The parent no longer carries an independent
   etymology, which removes the Strophos/Verso twist-and-turn pairing as a brand
   device (Verso keeps its own meaning as the rendering-surface layer). Swept
   through every living doc, README, and crate description in one pass; archived
   docs and the history sections above were left as written.

   **Known trade-off, accepted:** *Merely* is a common English adverb. It is
   weakly distinctive as a mark (the trademark literature's own phrase for the
   failure mode is "merely descriptive"), it is hard to search for, and a short
   dictionary word is unlikely to be free as an org slug. That is the opposite
   problem from the collisions that killed Carta, Camino, Tela, and Lemni: not a
   conflict, a distinctiveness cost. Recorded here so it is a decision rather
   than an oversight.

4. **Merely confirmed; org slug registered** (2026-07-10). Before committing,
   the name was challenged against a full bench: the smallholding register
   (croft, steading, whittle), the gift register (lagniappe's family: handsel,
   fairing, benison, boon, windfall, whet), buoy, and the mark/marquis family
   (waymark, marque). Buoy fell to live companies (Buoy Health among others).
   **Croft**, the strongest challenger, fell to a genuine collision: an active
   `croft` dev-tool crate on crates.io (updated 2026-05, same audience), the
   bare GitHub slug taken, plus the Lara Croft (Square Enix, Class 9) and Croft
   port-house shadows. Merely's own objections dissolved on inspection: its
   weakness is not a collision (nothing found occupying it), and the
   Simply / Very / The Ordinary precedent shows understatement marks register
   and thrive, with "Merely Software" as the composite fallback if registration
   is ever wanted. GitHub org **merely-made** registered 2026-07-10 (bare
   `merely` taken; `-made` over `-hq` because it completes the adverb and reads
   as a colophon). Croft benched with affection as a possible future colloquial
   place-name inside the family.

Other rejected candidates (with reason): Carta (Carta, Inc. wall), Camino (Mozilla Camino® + camino crate), Tela (Schlumberger + tela.com), Waystone (Waystone Group financial), Almagest (Almagest Space Corp.), Holon (Holon Solutions/Platform), Duende (Duende Software/IdentityServer), Synoche (user reported conflict), Snicket (Snicket Labs Feb 2026 rebrand same metaphor), Holloway (Holloway.com publishing platform), Postern (dead Android proxifier ghost), Foundry (Foundry VTT + Foundry FX), Caster (`caster` crate taken), Motif (X11 Motif® + motif.io VC + crate), Syzygy (WPP-owned digital agency), Lemni (Sequoia-backed AI-agent), and others (see [`project_naming_state.md`](<user-home>\.claude\projects\c--Users-mark--Code\memory\project_naming_state.md) for the full list).

## 7. Pending mechanical work (updated 2026-06-09)

Most of the original list has executed:

1. **`cargo publish`** — names reserved; ongoing as needed.
2. **Donor `graphshell/design_docs/` harvest** — done; the donor repo was GitHub-archived and its local clone deleted 2026-05-27, its 633 docs swept into the [full harvest](mere_docs/research/2026-05-27_graphshell_docs_full_harvest.md) and [concept brief](mere_docs/research/2026-05-17_graphshell_harvest_brief.md) indexes.
3. **Cable migration** — superseded: the bilateral substrate pivoted to p2panda (Cable wire deleted; `P2pandaTransport` live).
4. **Donor `graphshell/` repo code salvage** — done (engines, `import`, the `register-*` cluster, `murm` misfin/webfinger pulled); repo archived.
5. **CLAUDE.md global instructions** still reference Graphshell; update when Mark wants the global config to track the rename.
6. **`servo-wgpu` → `genet` and `webrender-wgpu` → `netrender` renames** — done (`repos/genet`, `repos/netrender`).
