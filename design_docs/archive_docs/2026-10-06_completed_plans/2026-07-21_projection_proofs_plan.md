# Projection Proofs Plan

**Date**: 2026-07-21
**Status (2026-10-06):** P1–P5 complete on main: the P3/P4/P5 slices were
committed (`f78ea81e`, 2026-07-22) and closed by `93ca150f` (2026-07-26,
"Projection proofs are done"), P3 with a green two-process headed receipt. The
scenograph family was absorbed into mere by `6a37de6b` and moved to
`crates/cambium/scenes` by `3e4d5098`; its
[0.0.3 release plan](2026-07-24_scenograph_0_0_3_release_plan.md) is
complete. Open: live radio facts for P5; the naming drift between the two
display-name tables (the scenomise catalog says "L-system" and "Kanban" where
the canvas catalog carries the ratified Fractal and Columns); and the
arrangement pull, which `270172db` (2026-10-03) removed and which now belongs
to the [dynamics grammar plan](../../mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-10-02_dynamics_grammar_plan.md).
Executes the five-proof sequence from the
[projection_engine_prior_art_brief](../../mere_docs/research/2026-07-21_projection_engine_prior_art_brief.md)
§9.

## Plan

- **P1 — wire the analytic catalog through turnstone (DONE 2026-07-21).** The
  smoke test: one strategy exposed as a palette action, projected through the
  canvas's recompute gate, applied per frame, headed receipt. Done condition
  met: `RESULT ok` +
  `testing/turnstone/images/scenarios/proof1_projection/{01_force_baseline,02_phyllotaxis,03_force_restored}.png`.
- **P2 — the portable scene contract.** Point, rectangle, and polygon
  footprints; instance ids; coordinate spaces; representation slots (brief
  §5), landing in `sceno` with mere as first consumer. This is where the
  `cartography::Projection` point+radius ceiling lifts and where P1's overlap
  finding gets its fix.

  **Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** done. P2's first slice landed in
  `sceno` and its consumption slice in mere on 2026-07-22 (Progress), closed
  with the rest by `93ca150f`.
- **P3 — pane spiral.** Move the kernel-neutral Spiral solver into
  `scenomise`; keep the graph-to-scene adaptation in `mere-cartography`.
  Persist one product-free score and prove that its measurements give
  footprint-aware placement. Recency drives scale; the realization traverses
  glyph, card, snapshot, and focused live-pane LOD. **Implemented
  2026-07-22:** score + solver + graph adapter, durable revisit timestamps,
  session-sidecar save/rebind, and a two-process headed scenario pair. The
  score proves selected LOD; a richer host realization of those slots remains
  separate presentation work, not a type-system claim.
- **P4 — Isometry consumes that same contract** for its overmap and one
  tile-board projection. Delete `Overmap::layout` rather than wrapping it;
  Isometry's adapter keeps campaign truth, authored pins, and paint local.
  The receipt must serialize the same score/scene vocabulary as P3, and an
  audit of `sceno`/`scenomise` types must contain neither `mere` nor
  `isometry`.
- **Boundary consolidation — after the two-product proof.** Finish moving
  the generic Spiral out of Mere; tighten `mere-cartography` and
  `mere-canvas` around the graph-specific remainder. Done for the proved
  shape: every canvas Spiral dispatch now passes through the shared score and
  solver, while `arrangements` remains only for its distinct nonportable
  catalog entries. No Cambium/Sprigging API was extracted: the two consumers
  presently agree only on the existing `GraphCanvasSwatch` contract. This is a
  boundary map, not a cleanup queue.
- **Graphshell — begin only after the second-consumer boundary is real.**
  Its first work consumes the consolidated Scenograph vocabulary; it does not
  create a competing abstraction while P3/P4 are still proving one.
- **P5 — fixture-driven geographic projection** over that consolidated
  boundary is implemented as a serialized coastal-map fixture: an ordinary
  low-layer map underlay plus geographic source facts, preserved through
  score-to-scene realization. Live Retinue/Tulle/Sennet location facts wait
  for an actual radio fact surface; none exists in those products today.

  **Open, raised by the S14 pass (2026-10-06):** retinue's position
  disclosure plan (2026-09-01) records its PD1 and PD2 as implemented in
  software. Does that count as the radio fact surface P5's live half waits
  for? Options: yes, and P5's live half becomes adapting it; no, P5's live
  half waits for a product to expose location facts.

**Done overall** = one persisted, product-free score vocabulary drives the
Mere pane spiral, the Isometry overmap and board, and the geographic fixture;
neither portable crate nor serialized scene type mentions either product.

## Findings

- **P1 confirmed the "separate lanes" diagnosis exactly.** The canvas strategy
  seam (`set_layout_strategy` / `needs_strategy_recompute` /
  `apply_strategy_positions` / `note_strategy_computed`) was complete,
  documented, and host-ready; the entire gap was the host loop. The turnstone
  wiring is ~60 lines: an `Action::SetLayoutStrategy(Option<&'static str>)`
  variant + two palette entries (`action.rs`), a dispatch arm + an
  `App::drive_layout_strategy(w, h)` host loop (`app.rs`), the drive call
  before both canvas `frame()` sites (`shell.rs`), and two scenario-runner
  verbs (`script.rs`: `layout_phyllotaxis` / `layout_force`).
- **The footprint channel is now an empirical finding, not a prediction.**
  `phyllotaxis.default` at 15 nodes packs the spiral into heavy node overlap
  (capture 02): the projection emits positions only, node extents are ~40px
  canvas squares the strategy cannot see, and nothing scales spacing to
  extent. The failure is missing placement *data* (footprints / spacing
  awareness), not missing wiring — the exact distinction P1 existed to make.
  Configurability note: per-strategy scale/spacing settings are the cheap
  palliative; the real fix is P2's extent-aware contract.
- **`project_canvas_strategy` discards all but positions** (radius, overlays,
  bounds dropped), as the review warned; the gloss lens path
  (`project_canvas_lens`) keeps overlays. Acceptable for P1; the boundary
  lift is P2's job, not a patch here.
- **The scenario lane absorbed the new action for free.** `act <palette
  label>` + self-capture ran unchanged; automation reach cost two mapping
  lines. Receipt of the one-tool-vocabulary doctrine paying rent.
- **Owed follow-ups** (**two closed 2026-08-18, ratified by Mark**):
  - ~~persist the active strategy as view-intent~~ **done**: turnstone writes
    a `view-intent.json` sidecar beside the projection score and restores it
    on session open. Kept a separate sidecar deliberately, because a score is
    recomputable from graph truth while *which arrangement was chosen* is
    not recoverable from the positions it produced, so without it a reopened
    session silently reverted to the surface default. Restored through the
    runtimes directly rather than the app arm, since that arm clears the
    score for a non-Spiral strategy — right for a fresh choice, wrong when
    restoring the pair. The sidecar stores the id, never the display name,
    pinned by a test.
  - ~~the layout picker derives its labels from the registry~~ **done**:
    `turnstone::action::palette_actions` now builds its `Layout:` rows from
    `CANVAS_LAYOUT_STRATEGIES` instead of hardcoding, which also lands the
    third item below for free. It returns `Vec<(String, Action)>` now; both
    call sites were already stringifying, so they got simpler.
  - **Finding, and a live hazard**: display names live in **two** tables —
    `arrangements::registry` (the arrangement register proper) and the
    canvas's `CANVAS_LAYOUT_STRATEGIES` (the picker catalog, whose ids
    distinguish dispatchable variants like `kanban.default` from
    `kanban.community`, which the registry does not). The Columns/Fractal
    rename had to be applied in both, and nothing enforces agreement. The
    picker correctly reads the canvas table; unifying them, or deriving one
    from the other, is the next cleanup and belongs before a third table
    appears.

    **Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** the arrangements crate was absorbed
    in `cc40c24f` (2026-08-22). Its successor, the scenomise catalog
    (`crates/cambium/scenes/scenomise/src/catalog.rs`), shows "L-system" and
    "Kanban", disagreeing with the ratified Fractal and Columns that
    `CANVAS_LAYOUT_STRATEGIES` carries
    (`crates/canvas/pictograph/src/canvas/cartography_scene.rs`); Turnstone's
    `palette_actions` reads the canvas table.

    **Open, raised by the S14 pass (2026-10-06):** which display-name table
    is authoritative? Options: the canvas's `CANVAS_LAYOUT_STRATEGIES`, with
    the scenomise catalog renamed to Fractal and Columns; the scenomise
    catalog, with the canvas table derived from it.
  - Still open: a checkmarked layout picker surface (palette-only today).

    **Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** Turnstone's Arrange pane exists
    (its `arrange_pane.rs`, turnstone `f7a5388`, 2026-09-03).

## Arrangement naming (plain vocabulary, stack-consistent)

The Merely brand's projection grid (mosaic / spiral / atlas / hulls / workbench)
names the arrangements in plain product words. Adopting them requires honoring a
distinction the brand blurs: **the stack has two name registers, and they must
not collide.**

- **Surface register** (what hosts content, code-verified heavy use): orrery,
  workbench, gloss, roster, inspector, apparatus, trail, steward. Off-limits as
  arrangement names. The brand's "orrery" and "workbench" cells are *surfaces*,
  not arrangements — orrery's default arrangement is force-directed; workbench's
  behavior is symmetric splits.
- **Arrangement register** (how nodes are placed inside a surface): the plain
  display names below. The `graph_layout:*` id stays the persistence key; only
  `display_name` carries the plain word.

| Arrangement id | Plain name | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `graph_layout:phyllotaxis` | **Spiral** | done (registry + palette) | brand "spiral"; age-shrink is P3 |
| (force-directed / seiche `None`) | Force-directed | done (palette) | orrery's native arrangement; keep honest name |
| `graph_layout:grid` | Grid | plain already | |
| `graph_layout:radial` | Radial | plain already | volvelle = a *moot* radial, different concept |
| `graph_layout:timeline` | Timeline | plain already | |
| `graph_layout:kanban` | **Columns** | **RATIFIED 2026-08-19** | categorical column placement; distinct from portable regular-cell Grid |
| `graph_layout:penrose` | Penrose | keep | aperiodic tiling; **not** Mosaic (proper noun ok) |
| `graph_layout:lsystem` | **Fractal** | **RATIFIED 2026-08-18** | was L-System (jargon); Mark accepted the standing proposal |
| `graph_layout:semantic_embedding` | Semantic | keep | a coordinate source for **Plotted**, below |
| (spectral) | Spectral | keep | jargon; no clean plain word |
| ~~*(future, P4)* adjacency tiling~~ | ~~Mosaic~~ | **RELEASED to the scene register 2026-08-18** | Mosaic's placement lever is **Grid** (packing variant); see the ruling below |
| *(future, P5)* data-given coordinates | **Plotted** | **RATIFIED 2026-08-18** | positions supplied by the data and preserved relative to each other. Generalizes Semantic and may converge with Geographic when a consumer forces it; physics is orthogonal |
| ~~*(future, P5)* geographic~~ | ~~Atlas~~ | **RELEASED to the scene register 2026-08-18** | Atlas's placement lever is **Plotted**, above; see the ruling below |
| *(future)* burn-kinship regions | **Hulls** | reserved | brand "hulls"; ties to the fields/hulls primitive |
| *(future)* joint-constrained bodies | **Armature** | **ratified 2026-07-31, DISPLAY NAME ONLY** | positions fixed by attachment frames, never force-settled — the nested-graph-scale sibling of orrery. First consumer: the games wing's live body swatch (a critter's body is a nested graph; see `mesocosm/design_docs/2026-07-30_body_pipeline_and_host_probe_plan.md` §3). **Never a crate name**: `armature` is taken on crates.io (an event-driven stateful actor framework, 0.1.1, 2021, dormant), and its domain is adjacent to **armillary**, so publishing under it would collide twice over. The `graph_layout:*` id stays the persistence key, as for every arrangement |

**Three registers, not two (ruled with Mark 2026-08-18).** A **scene** is a
reusable total projection regime: every lever flexed toward one product
intent, portable to a second dataset. Mosaic and Atlas are scenes, and their
reservations above are released from the arrangement register to it, because
neither name describes a placement rule. There is no Atlas without a map,
since geographic placement over nothing is a scatter of dots and the backdrop
is what makes a position mean a place; and Mosaic's adjacency-as-edge needs
tiles that *size themselves* to close the gaps, so its representation lever
does half the work of its edge lever. The intent lives in a combination no
single lever holds, which is why the scene is the reusable unit. Arrangement
names stay plain mechanism words, and a scene template must carry every lever
it depends on rather than a placement id plus defaults. The scene deck is in
the [content catalog](../../mere_docs/research/2026-08-18_scenograph_content_catalog.md);
surface names remain off-limits to both other registers.

Collision checks (2026-07-22): `mosaic` zero hits stack-wide; `atlas` only a
"font/SVG atlas" texture ref in graph-kernel; `spiral` only an internal grid
traversal + phyllotaxis config word (Spiral-the-display-name is unambiguous at
the picker level). Isometry's `overmap` is a *surface* (its travel map), the
same surface-vs-arrangement split as orrery-vs-force-directed; when isometry
consumes scenograph (P4) it keeps "overmap" and may render via the Atlas
scene. Phyllotaxis→Spiral and L-System→Fractal are landed. The former Board
display name is now Columns so it cannot collide with portable Grid or the
Tabletop scene.
The proper consistency end-state is the checkmarked layout picker deriving its
labels from the registry `display_name` (owed follow-up), so turnstone stops
hardcoding labels; today the hardcoded palette label is kept *matching* the
registry.

**Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** this follow-on is no longer owed. The
Findings record the picker's labels derived from `CANVAS_LAYOUT_STRATEGIES`
since 2026-08-18, and Turnstone's Arrange pane (`f7a5388`, 2026-09-03) is the
picker surface; the remaining drift is between the two tables (see Findings).

## Progress

- 2026-07-21: **P1 landed.** Scenograph family founded and pushed
  (`5a730e1`). Turnstone wiring per Findings; `cargo check` green (bin, own
  cwd); headed receipt via the self-drive scenario lane
  (`scenarios/proof1_projection.scn`, fresh `TURNSTONE_ROOT` profile):
  force-directed baseline → phyllotaxis applied (physics halted, analytic
  layout holds still) → revert re-settles. `RESULT ok`, three captures,
  whole-frame check clean. Turnstone changes left uncommitted for Mark's
  review.
- 2026-07-22: **Merely brand read + plain-vocabulary rename (with Mark).** The
  brand doc's animated mark *is* this engine (one graph re-projecting between
  force-directed / mosaic / spiral / atlas; "the projection decides what a node
  *is*"), and its projection grid supplies plain product names. Ruled: brand
  palette + NODE_SHEET re-color are deferred to tinct theming / stylesheet
  customization (not hardcoded now). Applied the arrangement rename
  Phyllotaxis→**Spiral** consistently — registry `display_name`, turnstone palette
  label, scenario `act` label, script verb `layout_spiral` — after the
  stack-consistency survey that produced the two-register model + naming table
  above. Registry rename is display-only (id/tags unchanged); `Board`/`Fractal`
  proposals recorded but not applied. Re-ran the scenario to confirm the renamed
  `act Layout: Spiral` label resolves.
- 2026-07-22: **P2 first slice landed in sceno** (scenograph `c2719ab`, 12
  tests): geometry (similarity `Transform2`), `Footprint`
  (Point/Circle/Rect/Polygon/Path + bounds — the proof-1 fix's type),
  `Scene` (interned `SourceRef`s making source-vs-instance structural;
  `Space` chains with cycle-safe `to_world` — the frames ruling as data;
  `ProjectedItem` with representation slot + hit shape; `RoutedRelation`;
  `Region` absorbing ClusterHalo and serving the hulls lane), and
  `Measurements` (the representation-measures input half). Decisions + open
  questions in `scenograph:design_docs/2026-07-22_scene_contract_note.md`,
  written for Mark's review **before** mere wires on. Deferred on purpose:
  Score types, intents, diffs, per-item emphasis channels, 3D variants.
  Next slice: mere consumes (scene-shaped strategy output beside
  `cartography::Projection`; phyllotaxis reads `Measurements`; re-run
  proof-1 scenario showing the spiral clear its cards).
- 2026-07-22: **P2 consumption slice landed — mere consumes sceno, and the
  spiral clears its cards (headed receipt).** Dependency: mere consumes
  `sceno` as a git sibling (`scenograph.git` branch=main in the workspace
  block; local checkout via the gitignored `.cargo/config.toml` patch, the
  armillary pattern). Extent lane: `ViewIntent.extents` (per-node `(w, h)`,
  view-config like `axis_values`, additive contract) →
  `CartographySceneOptions.extents` → dispatch → `PhyllotaxisAdapter`
  effective scale = `config.scale.max(max_side × 1.6)` (√2 axis-aligned
  clearance ÷ ~0.9 Vogel neighbor compression), locked by a
  no-pair-overlaps unit test; `Canvas::strategy_extents()` measures from
  `node_size` (per-node overrides + degree/importance channels ride along);
  turnstone's drive loop passes them. Scene lane: `cartography::scene_out`
  (`scene_from_projection` + `MERE_GRAPH_ADAPTER`): positioned nodes →
  items with Rect-from-measurement / Circle-from-radius / Point footprints,
  caller-supplied stable ids (Uuid, never NodeKey), edges → routed
  relations with weight + path, `ClusterHalo` → `Region`,
  `ImportanceScale` → transform scale; 5 tests; no live consumer yet
  (stated honestly — the swatch/cambium consumer is a later slice). Label
  consistency: `CANVAS_LAYOUT_STRATEGIES` "Phyllotaxis" → "Spiral" (the
  second display-name table, now matching the registry). Tests: cartography
  16 + arrangements 88 + canvas 137 green; turnstone rebuilt; scenario re-run
  fresh-profile `RESULT ok` — capture 02 now shows a legible golden-angle
  spiral with every 36px box clear (the P1 overlap capture is overwritten
  on disk; the finding text stands as its record). **Follow-ups surfaced**:
  `needs_strategy_recompute` does not key on extents (a node resize under
  an active analytic layout waits for a revision/viewport/focus change to
  re-space; add an extents fingerprint to the cache inputs); the subgraph
  path passes no extents (NodeKeys do not survive the re-add; thread ids if
  the gloss wants measured re-layout).
- 2026-07-22: **P3a landed — recency drives scale + the Spiral's ordinal.**
  Two channels, both deterministic-tested. **Ordinal**: `SpiralOrdering`
  on `PhyllotaxisAdapter` (kernel-aware layer, not the portable config) with
  `RecentFirst` sorting by `last_visited` desc (stable, epoch fallback) so
  ordinal 0 — the `Outward` center — is the newest node; the meristem /
  brand "age shrinks what you leave behind" reading. **Scale**: a
  `size_by_recency` toggle on `Canvas`, mirroring size-by-degree/importance
  — `recompute_recency` normalizes `last_visited` across the graph
  (`0..=1`, newest = cap; a single-timestamp graph reads uniform, not
  collapsed), refreshed each `push_node_geometry` (cheap, no dirty flag),
  and `node_size` maps it DEFAULT..MAX (36..88) below a manual override and
  size-by-importance, above size-by-degree. Wiring: canvas dispatch takes
  `recent_first`, driven by `canvas.size_by_recency()`; turnstone
  `Action::ToggleSizeByRecency` (+ palette + `toggle_size_by_recency` verb)
  re-selects the active strategy to drop its cache. Added `Action::FitView`
  (+ palette + `fit_view` verb) exposing the shipped `fit_to_content` —
  analytic layouts land anywhere in world space and the extent-aware Spiral
  spreads wide, so the view needs an explicit fit. Tests: `arrangements`
  recency-ordering + `mere-canvas` recency-size unit tests (89 + 138 green);
  headed `proof3_recency` scenario `RESULT ok` (uniform → size gradient →
  newest-at-center Spiral, fitted). **Findings, honest**: (1) **`visit()`
  does not refresh `last_visited`** on an existing node (input.rs:284 just
  selects), so live recency currently reflects creation/ingest order, not
  last interaction — the receipt's gradient is the sample graph's
  construction order, and closing this is a precondition for recency as a
  real UX feature. (2) **The DOM gnode face is a fixed 36px** (build.rs
  `GNODE_BOX`); `node_size` drives underlay rects (demoted nodes),
  colliders, edge-trims, rings, and hit-testing, but not the primary painted
  face — so *every* size channel (degree/importance/recency) is only
  partially visible. Making the gnode face track `node_size` is the
  rendering follow-up that would make P3a (and its siblings) fully legible.
  (3) camera does not auto-fit analytic layouts (hence `FitView`). P3b (LOD:
  representation degrades card→glyph with recency, focus stays live) is the
  remaining half of P3.
- 2026-08-19: **P3b selection landed; visible realization remains.**
  Cartography's v2 representation profiles now declare ordered rung conditions
  over measured screen extent, normalized recency, focus, and zoom, with prior
  score state used for hysteresis. The Spiral adapter no longer contains a
  hardcoded size match. Graphshell's live web host re-evaluates its score from
  camera zoom and measured node extents after local view commands. Receipts
  cover card→glyph across zoom, focus→live-pane, stable placement, and boundary
  retention. The canvas still does not paint distinct faces from the selected
  score slot, so P3b remains open at the renderer boundary. Conditions also do
  not enter `sceno`; remote re-selection remains gated on a real consumer.
- 2026-08-19: **P3b renderer consumption landed.** `Canvas` now rebinds the
  score's `mere.graph` source refs once and applies the selected rung during
  its real DOM frame. `Glyph` rounds the node body and suppresses its caption;
  `Card` keeps the established labelled Canvas face; `LivePane` adds a framed,
  emphasized live-capable face. This changes presentation density while the
  score's measured footprint remains the common authority for placement,
  collision, picking, edge trim, and node size. `LivePane` is still a
  representation request, not evidence that browser or editor content has
  been embedded. Renderer receipts cover score rebinding, the three frame
  classes, computed caption visibility/emphasis, and graph-swap invalidation.
  P3b is closed locally. Portable rung conditions remain gated on a remote
  client that needs to re-select.
- 2026-07-22: **P3/P4/P5 boundary proof implementation.** `sceno::Score`
  now serializes the neutral `Spiral`, `Grid`, `Geographic`, and `Hulls` arrangements,
  measured footprints, selected representation slots, opaque source refs, and
  generation. `scenomise::solve` realizes it footprint-aware. Mere's graph
  adapter maps durable visit recency to score order, selects
  glyph/card/snapshot/live-pane slots, persists `projection-score.json`, and
  rebinds its source UUIDs into the canvas strategy buffer on session restore.
  Existing-node `visit()` now stamps the replayable visit delta, closing P3a's
  recorded honesty gap. The old arrangements Phyllotaxis adapter no longer
  drives *any* canvas Spiral path.

  Isometry deleted `Overmap::layout` and its force solver. Its views adapt
  authored pins to a geographic score or unpinned sites to the portable
  spiral, fit only the realized scene to the Cambium viewport, and emit a
  tactical ground board through the same score/scene types. The Isometry tests
  serialize both shared types and assert their type paths originate in
  `sceno`; opaque `isometry.*` adapter strings remain local return addresses.

  P5 adds `scenomise/fixtures/coastal_map.json`, containing a low-layer map
  underlay plus geographic facts and LOD selections. The fixture verifies
  disclosed coordinates, generation, LOD, and layer behavior. There is no
  Retinue/Tulle/Sennet location-fact API to adapt yet, so none was invented.
  Focused receipts: `sceno` 13 tests, `scenomise` 4 tests,
  `mere-cartography` 17 tests, `mere-canvas` 140 tests, and
  `isometry-views` 37 tests, and the Turnstone session sidecar test 3 tests.
  The headed P3 create/save run and independent restart/restore run both
  report `RESULT ok`.
- 2026-07-23: **The visible size channel landed, and verifying the receipts
  found the restore silently broken.** (1) **Gnode face fix**: the `.gnode`
  class baked `width/height: 36px` and the per-frame style set only the
  transform, so `node_size` drove colliders, edge trims, rings, and
  hit-testing but never the painted face — *every* size channel (per-node
  override, size-by-degree / -importance / -recency) was invisible on the
  node itself. The inline per-node style now carries width/height from
  `node_size`; the centring half generalizes `NODE_HALF * z` to
  `face * 0.5 * z` (identical at the default size); the favicon inset scales
  off the resolved face. Receipt: `proof3_recency` 02/03 now show the newest
  node markedly largest and the Spiral seating it largest-at-centre with age
  shrinking outward — P3a's claim is finally legible rather than inferred.
  (2) **Restore was recomputing, not restoring.** `restore_projection_score`
  set `last_strategy_inputs = None`, so the host's very next
  `needs_strategy_recompute` reported stale and rebuilt the arrangement from
  *live* inputs (recency off ⇒ uniform extents + graph-order ordinals),
  discarding the saved score before it painted. The verify scenario still
  reported `RESULT ok` because `assert nodes >= 14` / `assert visible` pass
  for any non-empty canvas. Fixed with a `restored_score_hold`
  `(strategy id, graph revision)` claim that the gate honours until the graph
  changes, the user picks a layout, or a recompute is recorded; pinned by
  `a_restored_score_survives_the_hosts_next_recompute_check`. The restart
  capture now reproduces the saved spiral position-for-position.
  **Lesson**: a headed `RESULT ok` is only as strong as its asserts — the
  deterministic unit test, not the scenario, is what guards this invariant.
  (3) **Receipt audit**: `Overmap::layout` is genuinely deleted (not
  wrapped); `isometry-views` calls `scenomise::solve`; `isometry-core` 37 +
  `isometry-views` 56 green; the portability audit finds `mere`/`isometry` in
  `sceno`/`scenomise`/`scenotime` only in doc-comment examples and one test
  fixture string — no types, deps, or code paths. **Open**: the restored
  score carries footprints, but the face still paints from live `node_size`,
  and `size_by_recency` is not persisted — so a restored spiral comes back
  uniformly sized. Either persist the size channel or let the restored
  score's footprints drive the face.
- 2026-07-23: **Physics promoted from a layout mode to a global capability
  (ruled with Mark), and the restored score now carries its sizes.**
  (1) **Footprint → face.** `restore_projection_score` writes each item's
  measured footprint onto the per-node size channel, so a restored spiral
  returns at the size it was saved with rather than uniformly. The score is
  the persisted truth for *both* placement and measured extent. Tradeoff
  recorded: restored sizes land in `node_sizes` (the manual-resize slot), so
  a later size-*mode* toggle needs `clear_node_size` to take over.
  (2) **Physics is a capability, not a mode.** Mark: "whether a given graph is
  affected by physics should be a global question that can apply to all
  layouts and arrangements... the idea of 'the mode with the physics' feels
  like a squandering." The code agreed: `physics_paused` already existed as a
  proper global gate (`settle_physics` is "the single gate every settle
  trigger routes through") but was **unexposed in the host**, while
  `set_layout_strategy` bypassed it with a direct `physics.halt()` — welding
  physics to the arrangement. Now: `set_physics_paused` is the one global
  control; picking an arrangement pauses *by default* through that visible,
  reversible flag rather than a hidden halt; `apply_strategy_positions` seeds
  the physics **world** (`physics.seed`, which already existed) so an
  arrangement is a real initial condition; `apply_strategy_to_view` re-asserts
  positions only while paused, so playing does not pin the nodes. The full 2×2
  is now reachable and receipted (`proof3_physics_capability`): Spiral paused
  (crisp analytic placement) → Spiral played (sim relaxes from the seed, the
  arrangement still selected) → free graph paused (the cell that was
  unreachable while physics was welded to the mode). "Force-directed" is
  demoted to what it always was: *no* analytic arrangement with physics
  running. Host: `Action::TogglePhysics` + palette "Play/pause physics" +
  `toggle_physics` verb. Pinned by
  `physics_is_global_and_composes_with_any_arrangement`; canvas 142 green.
  **Next rung (Mark's framing)**: arrangements plug into the broader capability
  set (size, colour, shape, physics), and *any* graph surface should be able to
  run physics — "even swatches should be able to become physics-directed
  graphs... a gesture, something like knocking twice on the graph's canvas."
  Swatch physics is a real build (the swatch contract is a static position map
  today; it would need a sim per swatch or a shared one) and wants its own
  slice. The deeper form is **arrangement-as-attractor**: rather than a
  one-shot seed, an arrangement's targets become spring anchors, which is
  exactly the coupling/field model — the same mechanism hulls use. That is
  where arrangements, fields, and physics become one design instead of three.
- 2026-07-23: **Arrangement-as-attractor landed — arrangements, fields, and
  physics are now one mechanism.** `seiche::AnchorSpring` (conatus `82ac70f`)
  gives each node a spring toward the slot its arrangement chose, applied
  after the graph's own forces so stiffness reads as "how much does the
  arrangement win". It is deliberately the same shape as `CouplingForce` — a
  target, a response, a strength — which is what collapses the arrangement
  lane and the field/hull lane into one design instead of two. Canvas side:
  `arrangement_pull` (default `DEFAULT_ANCHOR_STIFFNESS`) with
  `set_arrangement_pull`, and `sync_anchor_force` installing anchors only
  while *playing* (paused, the buffered positions are asserted directly, so no
  force is needed). At zero pull the arrangement is a pure initial condition —
  the seed-only reading — and the graph's forces take over entirely. Pinned by
  `a_playing_arrangement_pulls_as_a_field_not_an_override`; canvas 143 green.
  Receipt: the played Spiral now keeps its recognizable shape while relaxing,
  where the seed-only version dissolved into an unrelated blob.
  *Annotation, 2026-10-03:* reopened by the dynamics grammar plan's ruling
  F11. Mark: "Physics acts on an arrangement. Physics is not assigning
  coordinates that nodes are pseudo pinned to return to once a force acts on
  them. Arrangements are positions, not motion." The arrangement pull, swatch
  relax's pull toward slots, and the physics board's slot pull go to that
  design (`research/2026-10-03_arrangement_and_dynamics_brief.md`); the code
  is unchanged until it rules.

  **Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** it ruled the same day. The dynamics
  grammar plan's F18–F20 are dated 2026-10-03, and `270172db` (17:37 that day)
  removed `set_arrangement_pull` and `sync_anchor_force`.
  **Build-topology finding (cost of the sibling split)**: turnstone could not see
  the new force at all — mere patches numen/quint/seiche to the local conatus
  checkout, turnstone patched none of them, so it silently built against the
  published crates. Patching *one* is worse than none: local seiche path-deps
  local numen/quint, so a partial patch yields two copies of the same types
  ("expected `numen::coupling::CouplingResponse`, found `CouplingResponse`").
  The family patches together or not at all; turnstone's gitignored
  `.cargo/config.toml` now mirrors mere's set exactly. Generalizes the
  cargo-cwd lesson: after extracting a crate, every consumer needs the whole
  family patched, and a physics change now costs either a publish or a
  patch-sweep.
- 2026-07-23: **Swatch physics — the capability reaches every graph surface.**
  Mark: "even swatches should be able to become physics-directed graphs... a
  gesture, something like knocking twice on the graph's canvas." The blocker
  was that a swatch is a `GraphCanvasSubgraph` snapshot with no sim, and the
  obvious fixes were both wrong: rapier does not belong in Cambium (a widget
  toolkit) nor in the portable projection family (a contract crate). So
  `scenomise::relax` is dependency-free and deterministic — repulsion between
  placed items scaled by their measured footprints, springs along routed
  relations, and a pull back toward the arrangement's own slots. That last
  term is the `AnchorSpring` idea at swatch scale, so a swatch reads with the
  *same vocabulary* as the canvas (arrangement as participant, not authority)
  while the heavyweight sim stays where it belongs. Cost is stated honestly in
  the docs: `O(steps · n²)`, right for tens of nodes, wrong for thousands —
  a surface with a real sim keeps using it. **Consumer proof**: isometry's
  `overmap_positions_relaxed` loosens the realized scene before the viewport
  fit, locked by a test asserting relaxation changes placement but never
  membership, stays inside the normalized viewport, and is deterministic
  (`isometry-views` 38 green; workspace green under `--all-features` per that
  repo's guard). `None` keeps the analytic path, so the default is unchanged.
  **Gesture deliberately not invented**: "knock twice" is a good instinct but
  double-click collides with create-on-canvas in most tools, so the affordance
  wants its own ruling rather than an inherited default. The capability is
  reachable by API today; the gesture is a separate, deliberate choice.
  **Review sweep**: scenograph 29, seiche 53, `mere-canvas` 143,
  `mere-cartography` 17, `arrangements` 89, `isometry-views` 38 — all green.
- **2026-10-06 (S14 pass).** Status and claims corrected against the tree at mere 535bca11, from the D2 record in support/doc-audit/d2/batch_41_s14_phase_b3.md: status set to P1–P5 complete on main (`93ca150f`) with the scenes at `crates/cambium/scenes`, the P2 marker, picker, display-name and 2026-10-03 annotation passages corrected, and the authoritative name table and the radio fact surface raised as open questions.
