# Family-Shared Identity: One Persona Across Every Merely Application

**Status (2026-10-06):** shared-identity adoption landed for Graphshell, Turnstone, Knot, Woodshed, and Hocket; Hocket's return-to-own-identity UI remains intentionally unbuilt.

**2026-08-08.** Turnstone, Woodshed, Knot, Hocket and Cleromancy are separate
products and the same person's. A document sealed in one should open in the
next. They did not agree on where identity lives, so it did not.

Continues [`2026-07-22_identity-vault-ssh-agent_plan.md`](2026-07-22_identity-vault-ssh-agent_plan.md),
which built the vault and the opening ceremony (`personae::bootstrap`). That
plan answered *what protects the secrets*. This one answers *whose secrets* —
which persona an application opens on, and how every application agrees.

## The two roots, and why there were two

Identity was split across two lanes that had grown independently:

1. **The personae vault** — `%LOCALAPPDATA%\personae\vault`, a fixed
   per-machine path holding named profiles, unlocked by DPAPI or a passphrase.
   Turnstone's root identity already rode this, as does Hocket's, and the SSH
   agent serves it.
2. **The session-runtime wallet** — `identity/` and `personas/` under whatever
   data root the application passed. `ensure_local_device_identity` mints a
   device key *there*, so each application minted a different one.

Lane 1 was already shared and lane 2 was not. Worse, lane 1 was shared by
accident of the fixed path rather than by decision: every consumer hardcoded
`ProfileId("default")`, in five places across mere and turnstone. A vault
holding a work persona beside a personal one had no way to say which was in
use, and nothing could switch.

## What landed

### `session_runtime::shared_root` — one wallet root (mere)

`shared_root()` resolves to the platform data dir plus `mere`, overridable with
`MERE_ROOT`. `adopt_legacy_identity(shared, legacy)` **moves** an application's
private `identity/` and `personas/` into it on first access, refusing to
overwrite shared identity that already exists.

Moving rather than copying is deliberate: two copies of an identity is the
worse failure, because they diverge and nothing can say which is authoritative.
Adoption happens on access rather than as a migration step, so an application
that has not run since the split still finds its persona the first time it
looks.

**Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** the module is now `pandect::shared_root`,
in `crates/system/pandect/src/shared_root.rs` (`MERE_ROOT` at line 29,
`shared_root` at 41, `adopt_legacy_identity` at 67): session-runtime was
renamed pandect in `441e70f0` (2026-08-15).

### `personae::roster` — which persona (mere)

The missing half of `bootstrap`. It lists what the vault holds, remembers which
one was picked, and opens that one:

- `read_roster(storage, dir, description) -> Roster` — entries sorted by id,
  the chosen one marked, plus the backend's honest account of what protects it.
- `resolve_profile(storage, dir)` — the ladder: `PERSONAE_PROFILE`, then the
  remembered choice, then **the vault's sole persona when it holds exactly
  one**, then `"default"`.
- `remember_profile(dir, id)` / `chosen_profile(dir)`.
- `create_profile(storage, id, display_name)` — refuses to mint over an
  existing persona, because that would replace its master key and with it every
  certificate rooted on it.
- `open_shared(unlock)` — the one call an application makes.

The sole-persona rung exists for a specific trap: falling straight through to
`"default"` on a vault holding one persona named something else would mint a
second identity beside the only one the user has.

**The choice lives beside the vault, not in an application's data directory.**
That is the whole point — picking a persona in one application picks it in all
of them. It is a profile id in a plain text file; nothing secret, since the
persona names are already visible to anyone who can list the directory.

10 tests. `switching_personas_switches_the_derived_key` is the one that states
the property the lane exists for.

### `mere-persona-picker` — the shared list (mere)

A Cambium view over a `Roster`, built on `command_picker`, which already
supplies the interaction. This crate is the view-model: how a persona reads in
a row, which one is marked in use, what a vault with nothing in it says.

A crate rather than a module in `personae` because the view needs Cambium and
Cambium drags the whole Genet stack; `personae` is consumed by headless bins,
knot endpoints, and the retinue side of the family, none of which should build
a view toolkit to derive a key.

`roster_items(&Roster) -> Vec<CommandItem>` is public separately, so an
application showing personas in a menu or a settings pane gets the same reading
without the picker. Activation resolves by `ProfileId` taken off the drawn rows
rather than by index, so a roster that changes between render and activation
cannot select the wrong person; an activation that resolves to nothing is
dropped as a dismissal, which is the safe direction.

### `impl Backend for Box<B>` (muniment)

Which store a host uses is not always known when its types are named: Woodshed
seals to the chosen persona when the vault opens and writes plain files when it
does not, and both are the same store to everything above. Without this, that
choice is a hand-written enum per host delegating all six methods.

## Per-application state

| Application | State | What was done |
|---|---|---|
| **Turnstone** | wired | Knot's persona vault and device key come from `shared_root()`, on both the hosted and the spawned path. `adopt_legacy_identity` runs at boot. `HostedKnot::PersonaVault` lost its `data_root` field: a persona vault is never under turnstone's own root, and a field nothing reads is a lie about where things live. |
| **Woodshed** | wired | `open_store()` seals the practice session to the chosen persona, or writes plain files when no vault opens. |
| **Knot's binaries** | correct as-is | `knot_endpoint` and `knot_sync_host` take the root as an argument by design, so a test can point them at a scratch profile. The caller decides, and turnstone's caller now says the shared root. |
| **Cleromancy** | nothing to wire | It has no identity. `CLEROMANCY_ROOT` holds product state (the redb store, sync settings); `admitted.rs` says outright that identity and transport stay outside. |
| **Isometry** | nothing to wire | `isometry-net` takes an `Ed25519Keypair` as a parameter. No persistent identity exists yet; when one does, `roster::open_shared` is the call. |
| **Hocket** | wired 2026-08-09 | Adopted into the vault keeping its key, or kept deliberately apart when the family persona is somebody else, with a confirmed one-way switch between the two. See below. |

**Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** the Turnstone row no longer holds.
Turnstone `d6c4bdc` (2026-08-22, "Route persona Knot authoring through the
resident") removed `HostedKnot::PersonaVault`; `enum HostedKnot` now has only
`Directory` (turnstone's src/knot_authoring.rs, lines 482-484), and
persona-vault mode goes through Graphshell's resident (`KnotHub::resident`).

### Woodshed's sealing is not a gate

Woodshed practiced without an identity before sealing existed, and a machine
with no vault backend — no DPAPI, no `PERSONAE_PASSPHRASE` — still has to be
able to open a tuner. So a vault that will not open is said out loud and
stepped over, never raised. `SealedBackend::adopting_plaintext()` carries the
migration: a session written before sealing was switched on is read once as it
stands, and the next save seals it. Nothing to run, and nothing to run in the
right order.

This closes the "deferred: host wiring" item on woodshed's
[`2026-07-08_personae_sealed_session.md`](../../../../woodshed/design_docs/2026-07-08_personae_sealed_session.md).

### Hocket looked like a key rotation (superseded 2026-08-09)

`hocket-genet/src/identity.rs` holds a live app-private identity: a
`SealedIdentityProvider` under Hocket's own data root, with a **contact token**
(the full public key, 64 hex characters) that musicians paste to each other to
address a hand-off back.

Pointing it at the shared vault changes its master public key. Every contact
token already shared stops resolving, and every hand-off envelope already
signed stops tracing back to its signer. Hocket's own source says this, about
the Strophe rename that forced the same question: a musician who already has an
identity would silently become a new person with a new fingerprint.

So Hocket needs the migration Strophe got — unseal under the old root, re-seal
under the new — plus an answer for tokens already in the wild, which is a
product decision, not a mechanical one. Left undone on purpose.

## Where the picker gets drawn

**Ruled 2026-08-08 (Mark): switching is live. A forced restart is the
exception, reserved for necessities, never the design.** An earlier draft of
this section called restart-shaped switching "the honest v1"; it is retracted.
What live means per application:

- **Graphshell** — free. The resident host holds `Arc<Mutex<IdentityVault>>`
  and the SSH agent shares the same handle, so `IdentityVault::switch_profile`
  (added for this) takes effect on the next operation of everything reading
  the vault. Nothing anywhere is told to die.
- **Woodshed** — reopen the store and reload: save the old persona's session
  sealed under its key, `open_store()` again (it reads the new choice), load
  whatever the new persona had. "Switching personas switches practice
  sessions" is the tested property; live switch is just doing it without the
  relaunch in the middle.
- **Turnstone** — the heavy one, and the machinery exists: `denizen::rebuild`'s
  re-root heal already handles "the root changed" by re-issuing grants from
  the reviewed projections. A live switch is an invocation of the heal, not
  new infrastructure.
- **Knot** — close the endpoint, open the new persona's. K2 built exactly the
  contract this needs: sessions on a vanished endpoint are told
  (`Disconnected`), never shown a stale copy.

Woodshed took a different route to the same rule (see below): the row raises
the shared picker rather than being a `Choice` whose `apply` swaps, so
nothing there is `RestartRequired` either.

**Graphshell is not just a consumer; it is a prior implementation.** Its host
was promoted to [`castellan::authority::PersonaeHost::snapshot`](../../../ports/castellan/src/authority.rs), which builds
`ProfileView { selected, id, display_name, slot_count,
master_public_fingerprint }` — the same list-and-mark-and-sort-by-id that
`read_roster` does, projected over the protocol as a secret-free read model.
One caution from reconciling them: their `selected` fields answer different
questions. `read_roster`'s chosen is the *resolved choice* (env, remembered
file, sole persona); `snapshot`'s selected is the *loaded current profile*.
After a switch they coincide, but under a `GRAPHSHELL_PROFILE` override they
must not — the UI shows what is, not what would be resolved. So the two stay
separate constructions, on purpose.

Graphshell also had **no switch intent** — `SSH_GENERATE`, `SSH_IMPORT_NATIVE`,
`SSH_REMOVE`, `DEVICE_REVOKE`, three signing-approval intents, and nothing for
the profile. It could show which persona you are on and could not change it.

### Landed 2026-08-08 (graphshell)

- `IdentityVault::switch_profile` (personae) — the vault-level switching the
  `ProfileId` docs had promised. Loads before replacing, so a failed switch
  changes nothing.
- `graphshell::profile` joins the family ladder: explicit `--profile`, then
  `GRAPHSHELL_PROFILE` (the application's own override, above the family one),
  then `roster::resolve_profile`. The device host resolves after opening
  storage — resolution without looking at the vault is how five hardcoded
  `"default"`s happened. Pair/unpair subcommands now resolve too, which fixes
  a real bug: they operated on `default`'s pairing settings regardless of the
  family choice.
- `PROFILE_SWITCH_INTENT` + `SwitchProfileIntentV1`: every non-selected
  profile card carries "Speak as this persona", payload bound to the profile
  id off the drawn card (identity, not row position). The host applies it
  live and then remembers the choice beside the vault for the rest of the
  family; the receipt says whether remembering happened, because "everyone
  follows" and "just here" are different promises.

**Observed 2026-08-09**, not just unit-tested: `persona_switch_receipt` holds
one agent session across a switch, never reconnecting it, and it stops serving
`work`'s SSH key and starts serving `alt`'s. That is the live claim in its
strong form; a session that had to reconnect would not have proved it. The
remembered choice and the projection's before/after offers are in the same
receipt (`testing/mere/persona_switch`).

### Landed 2026-08-09 (turnstone, knot)

**Turnstone** — `identity.rs::open_vault` was the last production
`ProfileId("default")`; it is now a thin wrapper over `roster::open_chosen`,
which is exactly the shape it had hand-rolled. (The `"default"`s in
`browser_host.rs` and `pairing.rs` are test fixtures constructing a `Profile`
directly, and stay.)

**The wallet lane got its own sole-persona rung.** Knot's persona is a
`PersonaId` (UUID) in the session-runtime wallet lane — a different namespace
from the vault's `ProfileId`, so the roster's remembered choice does not
apply to it. What does apply is the same resolution idea:
`wallet_store::list_personas(root)` (wallet-file membership, deliberately —
`personas/<uuid>/` also hosts engine profiles, so a bare directory is not a
persona), and callers resolve zero/one/many. One resolves silently; zero and
several are told plainly with what exists, because guessing among real
cryptographic identities is how a document gets sealed to somebody else. The
lane's fuller ladder (a remembered choice) grows when something exists to
write it.

- Turnstone's `TURNSTONE_KNOT_PERSONA` is now the override, not a
  requirement: unset, both the hosted and spawned Knot paths resolve the sole
  wallet under the shared root.

  **Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** Turnstone now refuses the variable in
  persona-vault mode: "Graphshell owner settings select the resident Knot
  persona; remove TURNSTONE_KNOT_PERSONA from Turnstone" (turnstone's
  src/knot_authoring.rs, lines 830-833), since `d6c4bdc` moved the persona
  route to the resident (see the table above).

- `knot_sync_host`'s two positionals are now optional: bare invocation is the
  ordinary machine (shared root, sole persona); one positional is read as
  whichever it parses as (a UUID cannot be mistaken for a path); explicit
  args remain for tests and receipts. `knot_endpoint` keeps explicit args
  only — it is spawned by hosts that already resolved.

### Landed 2026-08-09 (woodshed)

**The `SettingControl::Choice` this plan specified was the wrong shape, and
woodshed built the right one instead.** A dropdown over the roster would have
re-drawn the persona list a third way; what landed is a "Switch persona…"
button raising the shared picker as a gate, so the roster reads the same in
Woodshed as in Turnstone. That is what the picker crate was extracted for, and
the plan's own generalization argument points at it — the spec here was the
part that had not caught up. The startup gate (P1) and live switching (P2) came
with it, including the reset-before-restore that stops an outgoing persona's
practice being written into the incoming one's store.

Two decisions from that work worth carrying to the remaining consumers:

- **The gate is not a lock.** Escape practises with no persona at all: no key,
  no store, nothing kept. "Sealing is not a gate" carried one step further — a
  tuner has to open for somebody who does not want to say who they are.
- **Declining opens nothing, rather than falling back to the convention.** On
  the only vault that reaches the gate (several personas, none chosen) the
  convention resolves to `default` and *mints it*, so the fallback would have
  added a third identity beside the user's two.

What was still missing was smaller and is now done: the page offered to switch
a persona it could not name. `open_backend` had the persona and the vault
backend's own account of what holds the key, and only logged them; it now
returns a `PracticeSeal` beside the backend, every branch answering, so
"unsealed" always carries its reason. Settings reports three real states —
sealed, unsealed-and-why, and a declined gate, which is checked first because
the store never opened and a leftover seal would be a stale claim that the
session is being kept.

### Landed 2026-08-09 (hocket)

**The rotation was avoidable, so it was avoided.** This plan called Hocket "a
key rotation, not a wiring change" and left it blocked on a product decision
about tokens in the wild. That framing assumed the shared vault has to mint or
impose a key. It does not: a keypair can move into a vault profile unchanged,
which is exactly what Hocket's own pre-vault rename did when it re-sealed a
record under a new name and kept the fingerprint.

`roster::import_profile` (personae) is that primitive — adopt an identity,
keep its key. `create_profile` now delegates to it, and its refusal to write
over a taken id carries more weight here: the taken profile is somebody's real
persona and overwriting it destroys every certificate rooted on it.

`LocalIdentity` settles one of three homes, and only the harmless one writes:

| Vault state | Outcome | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Family persona absent | **Family** — Hocket's key adopted into it | Nothing to lose; the user gains a shared persona and their fingerprint does not move. |
| Family persona present, different key | **Apart** — vault untouched, Hocket keeps its own | Adopting over it destroys the other persona's certificates; following it silently makes the user a different person to every peer holding their token. |
| No vault | **Local** — the pre-vault sealed record | Unchanged from before this wiring. |

Which of the three a machine lands in depends on run order (a hocket-first
user adopts; a turnstone-first user goes Apart), and that is inherent rather
than a defect. What matters is that the divergence is *visible*: the circle
now reads "your persona X is a different key, and moving to it would change
the contact token you have already shared", beside the token rather than
buried in settings.

**So Hocket is not blocked; the decision is the user's, per machine.** The
picker wired to that sentence is the remaining step, and it is a step rather
than a leap: nothing switches until they ask, and the cost is on screen when
they do. Its persona-faceted timeline concept is sketched separately in
[hocket's design docs](../../../../hocket/design_docs/2026-08-08_persona_timeline_design.md).

### The switch surface (hocket, 2026-08-09)

Landed, and it is a confirmation rather than a picker. Hocket has exactly one
persona to offer — the family one — so a list of one row would be ceremony;
what the moment needs is the cost, stated in terms of a thing the user has
already handed to people. The confirmation names the first twelve characters
of the token on screen and says it stops reaching them.

**Consent is recorded against the key, not the profile name.** The user agreed
to be a particular person, not to follow whatever the family choice later
becomes. A family persona that moves to a different identity puts Hocket back
to `Apart` and asks again, rather than rotating a second time on the strength
of a decision made about somebody else. This is the rung that would have been
missed by storing a `follow_family` boolean, which is the obvious shape.

Accepting also clears the addressed reply: it belonged to the old identity's
conversation, and the next hand-off would otherwise go out as somebody the
peer no longer recognises.

Two defects the tests caught, both worth carrying as cautions:

- `settle_home` was handed an `Unlock` and then called `Unlock::from_env()`
  again part way through. That works by luck on a machine using
  `PERSONAE_PASSPHRASE` and fails everywhere else. Settling is now one vault
  open that answers everything.
- `fingerprint()` and `contact_token()` read the sealed record rather than the
  identity being spoken as, so after a switch the screen would have shown the
  old key while signing with the new one. Any application that can speak as
  something other than its own record needs its display routed through the
  same accessor its signing uses.

## Remaining

- ~~**Creating a persona.**~~ **Landed 2026-08-09 in graphshell**, as
  `PROFILE_CREATE_INTENT` on the vault card beside generate and import: it is
  the vault's action, not the action of whoever is in use.

  **It belongs in castellan, and it is in graphshell. Recorded as a
  misplacement, not a decision.**

  I first argued castellan was excluded by its own charter — "the faces, their
  derivation roots, and the vault substrate live in `personae`; castellan is
  the keeper who serves them" — and read that as a prohibition on minting. It
  is not. It is a statement about who owns the *repository*, which the
  composition thesis states outright: "Castellan owns no repository: identity
  truth is personae's (dramatis tier), and castellan is the keeper — custody
  without ownership." Not owning the store is not the same as not acting on it.
  By the reading I used, graphshell would be excluded too, since it also does
  not own `Profile`; it calls the same `roster::create_profile`.

  The [port law](../../2026-08-12_family_composition_thesis_brief.md) settles
  it the other way: "the stack owns the capability; the port is its
  first-party, coherent, embeddable embodiment; and another application
  composes the relevant subset." Identity is the capability, `personae` is the
  stack that owns it, **castellan is its port**, and graphshell is an
  application that composes it. The same paragraph names the failure this
  prevents: "where a capability is technically reusable but practically
  trapped inside its first application." Putting persona creation in
  graphshell — the first application that happened to grow an identity
  surface — is that failure, committed knowingly now that it is written down.

  **Resolved 2026-08-14: the keeper was founded and the whole surface moved.**
  Not just the create intent — the read model, the projection, and
  `PersonaeHost` all live in castellan behind the `keeper` feature, with
  graphshell re-exporting them at its pre-founding paths so no call site
  changed. The persona-switch receipt now imports castellan directly, which is
  the port law's own proof: a consumer composing the capability without going
  through its first application. See the
  [keeper founding plan](2026-08-14_castellan_keeper_founding_plan.md).

  Creating is deliberately not switching: a persona minted for another device
  is not one the user is adopting, so the new card arrives carrying the
  ordinary switch action.

  The id is **constrained, not sanitized**. It becomes a filename in
  `owner_settings::settings_path`, which replaces anything unsafe with `_`,
  so accepting `a/b` would let it and `a_b` silently share one settings file.
  The vault is safe either way (it hashes ids for record paths); the collision
  is the hazard, and creation is the only place it can be refused rather than
  papered over.

  Woodshed's own [persona picker plan](../../../../woodshed/design_docs/2026-08-12_persona_picker_plan.md)
  P3 still wants a local name input for its gate's create row, which is not a
  duplicate: the naming UI is app-local, the act (`roster::create_profile`) is
  already shared. Worth noting that woodshed's gate only appears with **more
  than one** persona, so its create row cannot be reached on a machine that
  has none — which is exactly when you need it. Graphshell has no such gate.
- **Hocket cannot go back.** Joining is one-way in the UI: there is no
  "return to my own identity", because that is a second rotation with the same
  cost and no caller has asked for it. The consent record is a single file, so
  the mechanism is there if it is ever wanted.

## Progress

- **2026-10-06 (S14 pass).** Status and claims corrected against the tree at
  mere 535bca11, from the D2 record in
  support/doc-audit/d2/batch_43_s14_phase_b5.md: the status line dated, and
  dated notes added for the pandect rename and for Turnstone's Knot persona
  route moving to Graphshell's resident (`d6c4bdc`).
