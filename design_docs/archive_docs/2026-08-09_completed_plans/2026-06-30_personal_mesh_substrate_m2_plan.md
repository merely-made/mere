# Personal Mesh Substrate M2 Plan

**Date**: 2026-06-30

**Status**: **Complete 2026-08-09.** Re-scoped 2026-08-09 after ESP
consolidation, then executed the same day. All eight done conditions carry a
test or probe receipt; deferred points are carried forward in §7 of the
[mesh lease scheduler plan](2026-06-30_mesh_lease_scheduler_plan.md).

M2 turns the M1 convergence proof into a bounded execution substrate. Its whole
claim is one versioned job namespace, one resource registry, and one useful
resource running through both. Leases, GPU scheduling, kith grants, and markets
remain later layers.

---

## 1. Current state

`crates/mesh/mesh` currently has:

- signed `MeshEvent` operations over LogSync;
- a deterministic `JobBoard` fold;
- inline-payload `JobPosted`, `JobClaimed`, and `JobDone` events;
- pure `Echo` and `Blake3` executors;
- retention checkpoints and history pruning; and
- a two-peer rehearsal path.

The checkout has no `JobSpec`, `JobNamespace`, `MeshResource`, or resource
registry. M1 proves transport, storage, and convergence. It does not yet prove
that a worker sees only the inputs and outputs granted to one job.

---

## 2. Ownership boundary

- **Mesh wire and board** own signed job facts and deterministic projection.
- **The host** resolves authorization, constructs the restricted namespace,
  advertises local capabilities, selects work, and supplies cancellation.
- **A resource adapter** prepares and executes only through that namespace. It
  does not read the mesh store, inspect the OS, choose a device, or mutate the
  board.
- **ESP** owns embedding behavior. The mesh adapter calls `esp::embed`; it does
  not reproduce a provider.

A `BlobRef` is an address and integrity commitment, not an authorization token.
The signed spec can name a blob, but only the local host can grant a resource a
reader for it. This is the difference between a namespace-shaped manifest and
an enforced namespace.

---

## 3. M2a: versioned job wire

Do not change the fields of the existing signed CBOR variants. Stored M1
operations must remain decodable and replayable. Add new variants, provisionally
named `JobPostedV2` and `JobDoneV2`; after the cutover, new writes use V2 while
the fold accepts both generations.

The first wire shape is deliberately smaller than the 2026-06-30 sketch:

```rust
pub struct JobSpec {
    pub resource: ResourceId,
    pub inputs: Vec<JobInput>,
    pub output: OutputGrant,
    pub requirements: ResourceRequirements,
    pub determinism: DeterminismClass,
    pub checkpoint: CheckpointClass,
}

pub struct JobInput {
    pub name: String,
    pub blob: BlobRef,
}

pub struct OutputGrant {
    pub name: String,
    pub max_bytes: u64,
}
```

`ResourceId` is an extensible, validated identifier such as
`esp.embed.lexical/v1`, not a closed enum. Registering a new resource must not
require a wire or board edit. Weights are named inputs when a resource needs
them. Scratch, metrics, arbitrary host calls, and cross-ring privacy grants wait
for a consumer rather than becoming speculative M2 vocabulary.

`JobDoneV2` records a content-addressed output plus the resource id and
implementation identity needed to verify it. Result bytes do not return inline.

Done for M2a:

- legacy events still decode and reproduce the same board;
- V2 specs and results survive CBOR and signed-operation round trips;
- malformed or duplicate input names, invalid resource ids, and oversized
  grants are rejected before mutation; and
- mixed M1/V2 replicas converge in a property or permutation test.

---

## 4. M2b: restricted namespace and execution control

The host constructs a `JobNamespaceView` only after checking the job and local
authority. It exposes named reads and the granted output writer. It does not
expose a raw `muniment::Backend`, filesystem handle, network client, or ambient
blob resolver.

Required negative receipts:

- reading a blob not named by the job fails;
- writing another output name fails;
- exceeding `max_bytes` fails without committing a partial output; and
- a digest mismatch fails before the adapter receives bytes.

Execution receives a host-owned control handle with cooperative cancellation.
The first adapter may finish too quickly to exercise preemption, but the seam
must not require a breaking rewrite when M3 owner reclaim arrives. Blob access
is asynchronous; the object-safe resource interface must therefore admit
asynchronous preparation/execution rather than hiding `block_on` inside an
adapter.

---

## 5. M2c: one registry, including M1

The registry maps `ResourceId` to an adapter descriptor and executor. It lives
above wire/store/sync and below the host actor.

Conceptually, each resource supplies:

- stable resource and implementation identities;
- capability matching against host-advertised facts;
- preparation through the restricted namespace;
- execution under the control handle; and
- a declared verification class.

Move `Echo` and `Blake3` behind minimal adapters before adding ESP. The old M1
wire compatibility path may translate its inline payload into an ephemeral
one-input namespace, but the executors themselves should have one route. The
board remains ignorant of adapter types.

---

## 6. M2d: lexical embedding resource

The first useful resource is `esp.embed.lexical/v1`, backed by
`esp::embed::LexicalEmbeddingProvider`:

- input: a canonical batch of UTF-8 texts plus configurable dimensions;
- output: vectors in input order, their dimensions and cosine metric, encoded
  canonically;
- dependencies: ESP without Burn, a GPU, model weights, or tokenizer assets;
  and
- product value: a cheap shared-vocabulary signal suitable for clustering and
  recall rehearsals.

`StubEmbeddingProvider` remains a test double. It hashes whole strings and does
not produce useful similarity; the earlier plan's claim that the hashed
provider was product-useful was wrong.

The verification class must be earned. Run the canonical output on native and
wasm. If the `f32` normalization is bit-identical, record the vectors as an
exact deterministic receipt. If it is not, use an explicit tolerance or add a
canonical integer/quantized result. A content hash proves which bytes were
stored; it does not by itself prove that every device should have produced the
same bytes.

Two-peer receipt:

1. One peer stores and posts a blob-backed text batch.
2. A second peer advertises and claims `esp.embed.lexical/v1`.
3. The host constructs a restricted namespace and the adapter executes.
4. The output is committed by `BlobRef` and `JobDoneV2` converges to both peers.
5. A local rerun verifies it under the declared verification class.
6. A deliberately ungranted blob remains unreadable.

---

## 7. Non-goals and stop rule

M2 does not implement:

- lease expiry, heartbeat, owner reclaim, or reputation;
- OS device discovery or foreground policy;
- Burn, WGPU, remote tensor execution, or training;
- kith grants, bounty escrow, or public verification markets;
- arbitrary Wasm execution; or
- generalized scratch, metrics, or host-call mounts.

Stop after the lexical two-peer receipt and compatibility coverage. The next
serial slice is the revised mesh lease scheduler plan. A long-running, GPU, or
remote resource may not land before that plan proves cancellation and owner
reclaim.

## 8. Done conditions

Every line below names the receipt that closed it (all in
`crates/mesh/mesh/src` unless stated).

- **V2 jobs are signed, versioned, content-addressed, and backward-readable
  with M1 history.** `wire::tests::v2_events_survive_cbor_and_signed_operation_round_trips`,
  `wire::tests::adding_v2_variants_left_legacy_bytes_untouched`,
  `board::tests::an_m1_only_snapshot_still_hashes_to_its_pre_v2_bytes`,
  `board::tests::mixed_generation_replicas_converge_in_every_fold_order`.
- **Namespace enforcement has positive and negative access tests.** The four
  required negatives are `namespace::tests::{a_granted_input_reads_and_an_ungranted_one_does_not,
  only_the_granted_output_slot_is_writable, an_oversized_output_fails_without_committing_anything,
  a_digest_mismatch_fails_before_the_adapter_sees_bytes}`.
- **One registry owns M1 compatibility adapters and the lexical ESP adapter.**
  `resources::tests::every_builtin_registers_under_the_id_it_declares`,
  `registry::tests::the_m1_kinds_run_through_the_v2_route`.
- **Adding a test resource changes neither `wire.rs` nor `JobBoard::fold`.**
  `registry::tests::a_test_resource_runs_end_to_end_without_touching_wire_or_fold`
  registers `test.reverse/v1` entirely from its own test module.
- **The two-peer namespace-backed job and verification receipt pass.**
  `sync::tests::a_blob_backed_lexical_job_crosses_two_peers_and_verifies`, over
  two real p2panda-net peers.
- **Native and wasm lexical result behavior is classified honestly.**
  Bit-identical on both: `crates/probes/mesh-lexical-wasm` compiles the same
  `lexical_codec.rs` source and the real ESP provider to
  wasm32-unknown-unknown, and Node reports the digest the native
  `resources::lexical::tests::lexical_determinism_receipt` pins
  (`4d0f647f…58aa01`, 801 canonical bytes). `VerificationClass::ExactBytes` is
  therefore earned, not asserted.
- **Malformed specs and results are rejected before mutation.**
  `store::tests::a_malformed_v2_spec_or_result_is_refused_before_mutation`.
- **A committed result cannot exceed its signed grant.**
  `board::tests::a_result_that_breaks_the_signed_grant_is_not_a_result`,
  `board::tests::a_result_from_the_other_generation_is_ignored`.

## 9. Progress

- **2026-06-30**: split out of the merged resource-coordination brief as the
  namespace manifest plus first-adapter slice.
- **2026-08-09**: re-scoped against the live M1 wire and newly consolidated
  ESP. Preserved signed-wire compatibility with V2 events; replaced the closed
  job-kind direction with an extensible resource id; separated blob addressing
  from host-enforced namespace access; added async/cancellation requirements;
  corrected the first useful adapter from the whole-string stub to the lexical
  provider; and made exact-versus-tolerance verification an explicit receipt.
- **2026-08-09 (execution)**: M2a–M2d landed in `crates/mesh/mesh`. New modules
  `ident`, `spec`, `namespace`, `resource`, `registry`, `resources/{legacy,
  lexical, lexical_codec}`; `wire` gained `JobPostedV2`/`JobDoneV2`; `board`
  gained `JobState::Committed`. 74 lib tests green (`cargo test -p mere-mesh`),
  clippy clean on the new code, every source file under the 600-LOC ceiling
  (largest non-test body: `store.rs` at 429).

  Structural learnings, per the implementation-feedback rule:

  - **The retention snapshot is signed wire too.** `JobBoardSnapshot` rides
    inside `MeshEvent::RetentionCheckpoint` and is committed to by digest, so
    adding V2 fields to `Job` would have broken every stored M1 checkpoint's
    own snapshot-reference check. The fix was the `MeshExt::prune_flag` trick
    one level down: `kind` became `Option<JobKind>` (byte-identical when
    `Some`) and `spec` is `skip_serializing_if`. The plan's "do not change the
    fields of the existing signed CBOR variants" needed to reach *inside* a
    variant, not just at it.
  - **Checkpoint payload erasure was M1-shaped.** It keyed off
    `payload.is_none()`, which is unconditionally true for a V2 job — under
    `PayloadRule::Keep` it would have erased V2 posting bodies. Erasure is now
    explicitly `spec.is_none()`; collecting a V2 *blob* is a different
    operation with no implementation yet (carried forward).
  - **One execution route was worth the churn.** Making `Echo`/`Blake3`
    adapters and routing M1's inline payload through an ephemeral one-input
    namespace deleted `worker::execute` outright, so there is no second path
    that can skip namespace enforcement. `next_action` gained the host offer in
    the same move: a device no longer claims work it cannot run.
  - **Adapters cannot write.** `MeshResource::execute` returns bytes and the
    runner commits them through the grant, so an adapter has no sink handle at
    all. That was not in the plan; it fell out of keeping the trait
    object-safe, and it removes a whole class of escape.
  - **Exactness was cheaper to prove than to argue.** The lexical pipeline is
    integer hashing plus one correctly-rounded `sqrt` and division, so it
    *should* be bit-identical everywhere — but "should" is not a receipt. A
    ~60-line probe that `#[path]`-includes the same codec source and runs it on
    wasm32 under Node settled it in one run, and the tolerance branch of
    `VerificationClass` stayed unused rather than speculative.

  Deferred, with reasons, into §7 of the lease scheduler plan: peer-to-peer
  blob delivery (operations replicate, blobs do not — the two-peer receipt
  stages the input on both devices and says so), tolerant verification
  comparison (`Verdict::NotCheckable` until a resource needs a decoder), and
  V2 blob retention/collection.
