# Genet-as-Host Flip Plan

**Date**: 2026-06-01
**Status**: Closed 2026-06-10. P0-P3 and P5's core done-condition shipped
(receipts landed in sibling plans, not here; see the closure entry at the end
of Progress). P4 (external content re-home) is re-homed to the modular
integration plan, S6. Archived per DOC_POLICY §8.
**P0 (perf spike) run 2026-06-01:
the relayout worry is retired (transform motion is paint-tier → `RepaintOnly`, not
reflow). The three genet prerequisites it surfaced for the orrery's continuous
motion (incremental inline-`style` invalidation, repeated-`apply()` restyle, and
transform→paint-position) are all RESOLVED in genet-layout (verified single-threaded
and parallel; see Phase 0). The orrery flip (P1) is unblocked on the layout/perf
side. The earlier `xilem_serval` host-backend blocker list is now closed in the
current tree: pointer-drag (`pointerdown`/`move`/`up` + capture), slider,
Tab/Shift+Tab focus traversal, and clip-aware scroll hit-testing are implemented
and test-covered.**
Execution plan for flipping Mere's host from Xilem + Masonry (architecture 1) to
genet-as-host (architecture 3). Cross-repo: sequences mere-side work against genet capabilities.
**Decision owner**: the [genet-as-host evaluation](../technical_architecture/2026-05-29_genet_as_host_evaluation.md)
owns the *call* and the §6/§7 worked consequences; this doc is the *execution*.

## Gate status (updated 2026-06-10)

The flip gate (evaluation brief §8) is **open on the genet-side prerequisites**:

- **IME — done.** All three tiers plus the underline-styled preedit landed in
  `xilem-serval` (genet `c7a78a5` "IME functionally complete", `944c070` T2
  preedit, `42d9d04` T1 commit + T3 candidate placement). This was the long pole.
- **Form-control breadth — done.** Stages 0 through 7
  are done: mutation API, runner, faithful event dispatch, component composition,
  keyboard/focus, capture phase, overlays + inline style, erased views, scrolling,
  z-index Tier 1, and the shipped controls (button, checkbox/toggle, single-line
  text field with glyph-positioned caret + selection + clipboard, select, radio,
  textarea, slider). The pointer-drag foundation (`pointerdown`/`move`/`up` +
  capture) is present and test-covered; it also gives the reusable primitive for
  scrollbar-thumb drag, resize handles, and drag-tab-out.
- **Chrome-critical follow-ups — done.** `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` focus traversal is
  implemented in the runner, and `GenetLaneView` hit-testing is clip- and
  scroll-aware for interactive scrolled content.
- **Perf spike — done (Phase 0).** §8's check that transform-only node motion
  lands on genet's `RepaintOnly` path, not `full_relayout`, at orrery scale has
  been run; the relayout worry is retired, and the continuous-transform
  prerequisites A+B+C are resolved.

## Findings (grounded 2026-06-01)

- genet and the mere Xilem fork share **vello 0.9 / wgpu 29**, so there is no
  renderer-stack reconciliation.
- `xilem-serval` is strong through Stage 7 (scrolling, z-index, overlays, a11y,
  select / radio / textarea / slider, IME), validated on screen.
- The **host-agnostic core is unaffected** (brief §5): kernel, forme, inker
  contracts, mere-domain, eidetic, gyre, and the whole field system (aether eval,
  gyre forces, the platen visual pass). The orrery **scene-paint underlay producer
  already exists** (`platen::orrery::orrery_paint_list`, `1110a26`); it is Phase-1
  layer 1, host-neutral by design.
- netrender has `compose_external_texture` / `ExternalTextureItem` (brief §3), so
  scrying re-homes; the GPU-interop core is host-agnostic.

## Plan (done-conditions, not dates)

### Phase 0 — The perf spike (gates the orrery flip)

Model node motion as `transform`, not `left`/`top`, and measure relayout incidence
on a moving N-node orrery (hundreds to thousands of nodes, 60fps physics) against
the `canvas_behavior_contract` scenarios, on genet. Genet-side; gates the orrery
phases below. Chrome phases (2–4) can proceed in parallel since they are flex/DOM,
not transform-animated.

**Done (2026-06-01, genet `6bf33947f`; spike + writeup in
[genet/docs/2026-06-01_orrery_transform_perf_spike.md](../../../../genet/docs/2026-06-01_orrery_transform_perf_spike.md)).**
The relayout worry is **retired**: a transform value change is paint-tier on
genet's pinned stylo (`RECALCULATE_OVERFLOW` < `RELAYOUT`), so
`IncrementalLayout::apply()` returns `RepaintOnly` — layout skipped, box geometry
untouched, at N up to 1000 (test-proven + source-verified). Transform motion does
NOT force reflow.

The spike surfaced **three genet prerequisites** the orrery's *continuous*
transform-driven motion needs (the relayout classification is necessary, not
sufficient). **All three are now resolved in genet-layout**, verified
single-threaded (85/85) and parallel (10/10 full-suite runs clean):

- **(A) incremental restyle ignored inline-`style` changes** — `snapshot.rs` marks
  them `other_attributes_changed` (only `[attr]`-selector invalidation), and genet
  emitted no hint to re-apply the inline block. **Fixed**: on a `style`-attribute
  mutation, force a full re-cascade of the element's subtree
  (`RestyleHint::restyle_subtree`); the inline-style pass re-parses the attribute
  each cascade, so the re-cascade re-applies it.
- **(B) a second sequential `RepaintOnly` `apply()` dropped the change** — stylo's
  `handled_snapshot` bit persisted across `apply()` calls, so a stale `true` skipped
  the next pass's snapshot. **Fixed**: reset `handled_snapshot` per attribute-changed
  element each pass. Continuous per-frame motion now re-registers.
- **(C) paint didn't fold the CSS transform into painted position** — `paint_emit`
  used the taffy `Layout.location` and emitted identity. **Fixed**:
  `compute_transform_matrix` folds the computed `transform`/`translate` into the
  in-flow `PushTransform`.

Memory-safety note (recorded in the genet spike doc): (A)'s first cut used stylo's
`RESTYLE_STYLE_ATTRIBUTE` replacement hint, which reused a rule node from the prior
pass against a per-pass-fresh `Stylist`/rule tree — a use-after-free that surfaced
as parallel-only heap corruption. First fixed with the `restyle_subtree` full
re-cascade (fresh rule nodes), then the proper fix landed: `IncrementalLayout` owns
a **persistent `Stylist`/rule tree**, so the cheap `RESTYLE_STYLE_ATTRIBUTE`
replacement path is restored and sound (per-frame inline-transform restyle no longer
re-matches selectors). Verified clean single-threaded and parallel, incl. a
400-frame sustained-motion test crossing Stylo's rule-tree GC interval.

Net: the gate's fear is gone **and** the orrery's motion mechanism (A+B+C) is
unblocked on the genet side. The tripwire tests were flipped to assert the
corrected behaviour and pinned as regression guards (stylo `572ecba`).

### Phase 1 — The orrery element (brief §6)

A genet custom-layout element composing three layers:

1. **Scene-paint underlay** — `platen::orrery::orrery_paint_list` (built)
   contributes its `PaintCmd` list as the element's paint sublist, under
   `PushTransform(camera)`.
2. **Physics-positioned DOM children** — gyre `cull_aabb` selects visible nodes;
   each materializes as a genet DOM subtree, `position: absolute` + a per-frame
   `transform: translate(x, y)` from the sim. Off-screen nodes demote to underlay
   glyphs (virtualization rides `cull_aabb`); focus/state survive demotion.
   **P0's prerequisites A+B+C are resolved** (genet-side): incremental inline-`style`
   invalidation, repeated-`apply()` restyle correctness, and folding the CSS
   transform into painted position all land in genet-layout, so per-frame
   inline-transform motion is honoured and visible. One materialization rule carries
   over: a node going from no transform to a transform relayouts once (it gains a
   containing block), then subsequent value-to-value changes are `RepaintOnly`; the
   orrery should materialize nodes already transform-bearing so steady-state motion
   never relayouts.
3. **Camera** — one `PushTransform(TransformSpec)` over both layers; the navigation
   defaults (wheel = pan, ctrl+wheel = zoom, inertia, infinite canvas) live in the
   element's input handling.

Two-hit-test split: node content via genet `FragmentQuery`; scene geometry (empty
space, edge pick, marquee) via gyre's `QueryPipeline`. **Done:** the orrery renders,
pans/zooms, drags a node, and shows force + visual couplings, hosted by genet,
fed by the producer + gyre. Node positions transition from committed to gyre-live
in this phase (the producer reprojects unchanged).

### Phase 2 — platen retarget (brief §7)

Morphorm → taffy/flex. platen becomes an `xilem_serval` consumer: it diffs the
forme tile-tree into genet DOM (flex containers, draggable dividers, tile
content-roots) and handles resize by updating flex-basis. Within-tile content is a
genet content-root (an inker/nematic engine's output as DOM) or an
`ExternalTextureItem` (WebView/scrying). Hybrid: flex for the docked split-tree,
absolute for floaters / sticky-notes. The canvas swatch is the Phase-1 orrery
element placed as a tile/region. The tiling *model* + interaction + serialization
stay platen's (they were never CSS). **Done:** the workbench tiling renders,
resizes, and rearranges through genet; the Morphorm dependency is dropped.

### Phase 3 — Chrome rebuild in `xilem_serval`

Rebuild the toolbar / omnibar / frametree / panes as `xilem_serval` views
(chrome-as-DOM), on a `pelt-live`-shaped genet host. Hold the **separate-roots
discipline** from the first commit: the chrome-root (diffed by `xilem_serval` from
app state) and each content-root (mutated by its engine/JS) are distinct document
authorities; neither sees the other's tree. `register-theme` becomes real CSS.
**Done:** the mere chrome runs as `xilem_serval`, on screen, with navigation +
panes working.

### Phase 4 — External content re-home

Web / scrying tiles move from Masonry's external layer to netrender
`compose_external_texture` / `ExternalTextureItem` (`texture_key` +
`content_generation` as the frame-arrival hint). The scrying GPU-interop core is
host-agnostic; only the compositor seam moves, and the destination exists (the
counter demo exercises it). **Done:** a web/scrying tile composites through
genet's external-texture path inside a content-root tile.

### Phase 5 — Cutover

A genet host (pelt-live-shaped) owns the window, input, layout, paint, script, and
accessibility; AccessKit emits from the one semantic DOM (no two-tree merge). The
`crates/mere/app` Masonry path retires. **Done:** mere runs on genet-as-host; the
Xilem + Masonry host is removed.

## Standing constraints (brief §9)

- **Stop deepening Masonry investment**; keep every new host-coupling retargetable.
- **Hold separate-roots** from day one (the invariant that goes wrong quietly).
- **Run Phase 0** before committing to render the whole chrome through genet.
- The **host-agnostic core needs no flip work** — kernel/forme/inker/mere-domain/
  gyre and the field system are consumed by the new host unchanged. The flip is a
  rebuild of the thin host-coupled layer, not an excavation.

## Progress

- **2026-06-01** — Plan created. At the time, the gate was read as open on IME +
  form-control breadth against the genet git log, with the §8 perf spike
  (Phase 0) pending (mechanism present, orrery-scale measurement not run). Later
  status corrections below supersede that early read: P0 is done, and the
  previous host-backend blocker list is now closed. The orrery scene-paint
  underlay producer already landed host-neutral (`platen::orrery`, `1110a26`) and
  is Phase-1 layer 1. No flip code written yet; this is the coordination artifact,
  and execution is cross-cutting across mere + genet.

- **2026-06-01** — **P0 run (genet `6bf33947f`).** Orchestrated a read-only recon
  workflow (6 agents) mapping genet's incremental-layout, then implemented the
  spike in `genet-layout` (instrumentation + 4 tests; genet-layout 80 tests pass).
  Verdict: the relayout fear is **retired** — a transform value change is paint-tier
  (`RECALCULATE_OVERFLOW` < `RELAYOUT`) → `apply()` returns `RepaintOnly`, layout
  skipped, box geometry untouched, N up to 1000 (test + pinned-stylo source). The
  spike then surfaced three genet prerequisites for *continuous* transform motion,
  now Phase-1 gates: (A) incremental restyle ignores inline-`style` changes; (B) a
  second sequential `RepaintOnly` `apply()` drops the change; (C) paint doesn't fold
  the CSS transform into painted position. A + B are pinned as genet-layout
  tripwire tests. Writeup:
  [genet/docs/2026-06-01_orrery_transform_perf_spike.md](../../../../genet/docs/2026-06-01_orrery_transform_perf_spike.md).
  So P0's measurement is done; the orrery flip (P1) is gated on A+B+C, all genet-side.

- **2026-06-01** — **A+B+C resolved (genet-layout).** Implemented all three P0
  prerequisites in genet-layout: (A) inline-`style` incremental invalidation via a
  forced subtree re-cascade, (B) `handled_snapshot` reset per pass for repeated-apply
  correctness, (C) `compute_transform_matrix` folding the cascaded transform into the
  paint `PushTransform`. While landing (A), found and fixed a memory-safety regression:
  the narrower `RESTYLE_STYLE_ATTRIBUTE` replacement hint reused a rule node against a
  per-pass-fresh `Stylist` rule tree (use-after-free, surfacing as parallel-only heap
  corruption); the `restyle_subtree` full-recascade path (fresh rule nodes) resolves
  it. Verified 85/85 single-threaded and 10/10 parallel full-suite runs clean. Tripwire
  tests flipped to assert corrected behaviour, pinned to stylo `572ecba`. **P1's
  genet-side gates are clear**; the orrery element (Phase 1) can begin.

- **2026-06-01** — **Persistent Stylist (cheap replacement path restored).**
  Follow-up to the A/B/C work: `IncrementalLayout` now owns a persistent `Stylist`
  (device + sheets + rule tree) built once in `new()` and reused every pass
  (`build_stylist` + `run_cascade_with_stylist`; `cascade_traverse` takes `&Stylist`;
  `maybe_gc` per pass; session stylesheets fixed at `new()`, debug-asserted). With
  the rule tree alive across passes, `restyle_with_snapshots` emits the cheap
  `RESTYLE_STYLE_ATTRIBUTE` hint again (no per-frame selector re-match), and it is
  sound — `rule_tree` is an owned field of `Stylist`, so the reused `ElementData`
  rule node stays valid. Verified 86/86 single-threaded + parallel clean, plus a new
  400-frame sustained-motion test crossing Stylo's rule-tree GC interval. The orrery
  per-frame inline-transform path now runs on the efficient incremental restyle.
  Remaining follow-up: stylesheet hot-reload (rebuild + full re-match that frame).

- **2026-06-10** — **Gate status corrected against live code.** `xilem_serval`
  remains a strong host-backend candidate: Stages 0-7 are done, controls include
  button, checkbox/toggle, text field with real caret/selection/clipboard,
  select, radio, textarea, slider, and IME is complete. The previous named
  blocker, pointer-drag (`pointerdown`/`move`/`up` + capture), is present and
  test-covered; so are `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` focus traversal and clip-aware
  hit-testing for interactive scrolled content.

- **2026-06-10** — **Closure.** The flip is executed in code, but this plan's
  Progress never recorded it: the receipts landed in the integration plan
  (S1-S4), the platen taffy retarget plan, and the orrery-element phase-1 plan.
  Anyone reading this plan alone concluded no flip code existed. Final state:
  - **P0 done** (entries above).
  - **P1 shipped as a host-side composition**, not the "genet custom-layout
    element" Phase 1 describes. Recon found genet has no custom-element /
    custom-paint hook; meerkat composites the orrery scene and DOM panes
    itself (orrery-element plan, archived 2026-06-09). The element framing
    here was never corrected; treat the archived plan as the receipt.
  - **P2 shipped 2026-06-04**, via the new `platen-view` crate rather than
    "platen becomes an `xilem_serval` consumer" as Phase 2 sketches:
    platen-core stays genet-free and the coupling lives in the view crate
    (taffy retarget plan, Architecture). Morphorm is out of the workspace.
  - **P3 shipped**: toolbar / omnibar / palette / frametree / panes run as
    `xilem_serval` views over the reused `chrome` domain, on the
    pelt-live-shaped present stack; separate-roots held. The meerkat-side
    wiring gaps the library credentials above do not cover (no `winit::Ime`
    arm, so no CJK input in the omnibar; the cancellation seam unconsumed)
    are tracked in the
    [host cheap-path plan](../../mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-06-10_host_cheap_path_plan.md), C6.
  - **P4 NOT built** — external web/scrying content re-home. `scrying-engine`
    has zero consumers and no WebView path exists in meerkat; the netrender
    destination (`compose_external_texture`) is real and exercised by
    meerkat's own actor textures. Live home:
    [integration plan](../2026-10-06_superseded_plans/2026-06-02_modular_integration_plan.md) S6.
    One correction to Phase 4's text: `content_generation` is not "the
    frame-arrival hint" — compositor-pass lowering defaults it to `None` and
    frame arrival is implicit at composite time (`paint_list_api`
    items.rs:326-340).
  - **P5 core done-condition met**: `crates/mere/app` (the Xilem + Masonry
    host) was deleted 2026-06-04 (`0066070`); no `crates/xilem` path-deps
    remain anywhere in mere. Remaining tail (orrery bin physical retirement,
    doc reconciliation) lives in integration plan §7.
  - The perf story this plan's standing constraints deferred (the chrome
    renders through the stateless per-frame pipeline) is spun out into the
    [host cheap-path plan](../../mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-06-10_host_cheap_path_plan.md).
  Plan archived to `archive_docs/2026-06-10_completed_plans/`.
