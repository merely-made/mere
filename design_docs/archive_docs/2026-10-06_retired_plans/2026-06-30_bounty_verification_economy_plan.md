# Bounty Verification Economy Plan

**Date**: 2026-06-30  
**Status (2026-10-06):** Planned outer-ring architecture; nothing built. None
of the proposed types (`BountyEvent`, `ResultSpec`, `MootEpochHeader`,
`WorkReceipt`, `RoleWitness`) exist, while the typed commitments it relies on
do (`proofs::Commitment`, `proofs::Digest`). Its standing ledger, Tessera, is
now mien's Standing (see Ledgers).

The bounty economy is not the mesh. It is the verification and settlement layer
that engages when work crosses beyond owned devices and granted kith.

---

## Boundary

Mesh substrate:

- moves signed job facts
- runs jobs inside namespaces
- routes leases and results
- enforces local device policy

Bounty economy:

- defines the result being bought
- escrows credits
- chooses verification tier
- accounts for fulfilment, lapse, and settlement
- updates reciprocity credit and tessera standing

Keeping this boundary clean prevents the mesh crate from becoming a market
runtime.

---

## Event Grammar

The economy is a ledger projection over signed facts:

```rust
pub enum BountyEvent {
    BountyPosted { spec: ResultSpec, escrow: CreditAmount, tier: VerificationTier },
    BountyClaimed { bounty: BountyId, lease: LeaseId },
    Submission { bounty: BountyId, artifact: BlobRef },
    VerdictCommitted { bounty: BountyId, commitment: Hash },
    VerdictRevealed { bounty: BountyId, verdict: Verdict, nonce: Vec<u8> },
    Settlement { bounty: BountyId, winner: PersonaKey },
    CommitmentLapsed { bounty: BountyId, claimant: PersonaKey },
}
```

The event names are design placeholders. The important part is that settlement
is a fold, not a mutable account table.

---

## ResultSpec

`ResultSpec` is the contract:

- expected artifact type
- input namespace
- acceptance predicate
- verification tier
- timeout and heartbeat cadence
- deterministic or non-deterministic settlement mode
- privacy class
- allowed worker ring

For deterministic work, the artifact hash can settle most of the dispute. For
non-deterministic work, the spec must name verifier rules before work starts.

---

## Verification Tiers

- `T0`: self-verifying hash or deterministic local rerun.
- `T1`: trusted-ring verification, light redundancy, or asker acceptance.
- `T2`: quorum, spot checks, commit-reveal verdicts, and higher escrow.
- `T3`: expensive proofs, trusted hardware, or institutional/native helper lanes.

Browser nodes should stay in T0/T1 unless the result can be verified without
native helper machinery.

---

## Ledgers

Two ledgers remain separate:

- **Tessera**: non-buyable standing from real fulfilment and reliability.
- **Credits**: spendable reciprocity or funded-bounty units.

Credits can appear at the cash edge. Tessera cannot. Spending is bounded by
standing, and concord stays one-hop. The funded-bounty lane must not crowd out
commons reciprocity or buy governance.

**Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** Tessera is not the live standing ledger.
It is now mien's `Standing` (`crates/moot/mien/src/ledger.rs` and its
neighbours), and gemot reads Tessera only as legacy: a `tessera.redb` file and
the `tessera_operations` serde alias (`crates/moot/gemot/src/moot/service.rs`,
lines 62-69 and 128). Read "tessera" in the Boundary, Moot Epoch Receipts and
Done Conditions sections as Standing.

---

## Moot Epoch Receipts

Tessera should bind help to the community state under which it happened. That
means receipts should name an epoch, not just a mutable moot id.

Minimum epoch header:

```rust
pub struct MootEpochHeader {
    pub moot_id: MootId,
    pub constitution: Digest,
    pub policy: Digest,
    pub epoch_number: u64,
    pub admin_commitment: Commitment,
    pub mod_commitment: Commitment,
    pub stakeholder_commitment: Commitment,
    pub member_commitment: Commitment,
}
```

The commitments are not plain roster hashes. They are typed by scheme and
domain, per the
[`commitment_proof_interface_plan`](../../mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-06-30_commitment_proof_interface_plan.md).
The first build should use sparse Merkle commitments for role rosters. Later
vector commitments, accumulators, or private-set-cardinality proofs can replace
that backend without changing the receipt shape.

Receipt shape:

```rust
pub struct WorkReceipt {
    pub bounty: BountyId,
    pub result: Digest,
    pub executor: PersonaKey,
    pub verifier: Option<PersonaKey>,
    pub moot_epoch: MootEpochHeader,
    pub role_witness: RoleWitness,
    pub capability_proof: Option<DelegationProof>,
    pub signed_at_ms: u64,
}

pub struct RoleWitness {
    pub role: MootRole,
    pub proof: InclusionProof,
}
```

Tessera then records "this persona helped under this moot epoch, role
commitment, capability proof, and result digest." Later value is a projection:
current moot policy can ask how many old members remain, whether the
constitution changed, or whether the signer belonged to admin, mods,
stakeholders, or general members. The historical receipt does not get rewritten.

The p2panda operation proves authorship, per-author log order, and replication.
The commitment proof proves the role or membership claim inside the receipt.
Those layers must stay separate.

---

## Done Conditions

- A deterministic bounty posts, claims, submits, verifies, and settles as a pure
  event fold.
- A wrong-hash submission is rejected.
- A missed heartbeat produces a lapse event distinct from owner reclaim.
- Verdict commit-reveal prevents a verifier from copying another verifier's
  answer.
- Credit and tessera deltas are derived from the event sequence.

## Progress

- **2026-06-30** - Split out of the merged resource-coordination brief and moved
  under `moothold_docs`, where the outer-ring economy belongs.
- **2026-06-30** - Added moot epoch receipts: tessera facts bind result,
  executor, role/capability proof, and epoch commitments instead of relying on
  mutable membership labels.
- **2026-06-30** - Replaced raw `*_root: Hash` sketches with typed commitments
  and witnesses, keeping p2panda operation identity separate from application
  proof roots.
- **2026-10-06 (S14 pass).** Status and claims corrected against the tree at
  mere 535bca11, from the D2 record in
  support/doc-audit/d2/batch_50_s14_phase_b12.md: the status is dated and
  records that nothing is built, and a vocabulary note records Tessera as now
  mien's Standing.
