# Substrate / Parallelism Composition Brief

**Status:** synthesis brief. Composes two existing docs; adds the seam analysis,
the co-located-actor decision, the serialization "better way", and the web build
budget. Codebase- and doc-grounded; external facts inherited at the confidence
levels of the source docs.
**Date:** 2026-06-21.
**Scope:** how the [cross-platform parallelism strategy](mere_docs/research/2026-06-19_cross_platform_parallelism_strategy.md)
(P-doc: how the engines go fast, cross-platform) and the
[DocumentScript substrate plan](archive_docs/2026-07-03_completed_plans/2026-06-21_document_script_substrate_plan.md)
(D-doc: what a script is allowed to reach, across languages, sandboxed) fit into
one stack.

One line: **they are two layers of the same stack meeting at one substrate.**
P-doc is the performance / portability layer of the engines; D-doc is the
capability layer over them. The script contract's capability profiles are grants
over the exact subsystems the parallelism work makes fast.

## 1. Where they physically meet

```

Three things straddle both docs:

- **The armillary actor boundary.** P-doc runs the genet cascade off the UI
  thread in a content actor and ships back `Send ContentUpdate::Scene`. D-doc P2
  hosts each script component in an armillary actor, "one per origin." Same
  substrate, different occupants.
- **The serialization seam.** P-doc's Scene-across-`postMessage` (cost #1) and
  D-doc's per-interaction canonical-ABI copy (cost #2, §7.2) are the same cost
  family. Both docs flag it; both leave it unmeasured. §5 is the joint answer.
- **The PWA / open-web fork.** P-doc establishes it (SAB threads are
  cross-origin-isolation-gated, so PWA-only); D-doc inherits it.

---

## 2. The apparent contradiction, resolved

P-doc: "WASI is out; Wasmtime is excluded by the no-JIT browser policy." D-doc:
"native-first on Wasmtime." These do not collide once the lane is named:

- **Native:** the component runtime *is* Wasmtime (Cranelift, or AOT `.cwasm` +
  a no-codegen executor). P-doc's "Wasmtime out" was only ever about the browser.
- **Browser:** D-doc does not ship Wasmtime either. It reaches the browser via
  the jco AOT polyfill (transpile component → core wasm + JS glue), run on the
  browser's own wasm engine. No JIT enters the browser in either doc.

Deeper agreement: P-doc §1 says WASI 0.3 is async *concurrency, not parallelism*;
D-doc §9 says the substrate is *concurrency + capability, not in-script
shared-memory parallelism*. Same distinction, stated twice. Aligned, not in
tension.

---

## 3. The parallelism axes line up one-to-one

| Parallelism | P-doc (engine) | D-doc (script) | Lane |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Across units** | inter-actor / inter-page, header-free (lever a) | "parallel across instances" (P2, §9) | both lanes |
| **Inside one unit** | SAB Rayon parallel cascade (lever c) | in-script threads (deferred, §8) | **PWA-only, hard-gated** |

"N pages render concurrently" and "N script components run concurrently" are the
same mechanism: one actor per origin, off-main-thread. A compute-heavy script that
ever wants threads *inside itself* inherits P-doc's entire SAB / COOP-COEP /
nightly-build-std apparatus, gated exactly like the parallel cascade.

The script kinds map onto the fork too: native extension / app scripts → PWA / app
lane; arbitrary legacy web JS → open-web lane, and per D-doc §10.1 it stays the
native `Runtime<Nova/Boa>`, never a component. The lane fork and the script-kind
split are the same line.

---

## 4. Decision: the script host is the content actor (co-located)

Both docs say "one actor per origin" but mean different occupants. Resolution:
**one per-origin `!Send` actor owns the genet engine *and* hosts that origin's
DocumentScript components.** The capability boundary sits at the *component* edge,
not the actor edge. On web, a jco-transpiled component runs inside the same Web
Worker as the engine. This is the first P2 design call and it is what makes §5
work (the script ↔ engine hop stays in-worker).

---

## 5. The serialization cost, and the better way

The fear: a scripted page on web pays the Scene clone (worker → main, cost #1)
*and* the component-ABI copy (script ↔ engine, cost #2) per interaction. The
correction:

- **Co-location (§4) makes cost #2 an intra-worker memcpy**, not a second
  `postMessage`. Scripting does not add a second cross-thread hop; it adds a cheap
  in-worker copy between linear memories.
- **Cost #2 is irreducible but small.** The canonical ABI copies by design (that
  is the isolation price; the model forbids shared heaps, D-doc §2.2). The
  per-turn batched contract (§10.2) + coarse mutation variants + a cached
  interpreter mirror (§10.3) make it one small copy per turn, not many per DOM op.
- **Cost #1 is the only expensive hop, and it pre-dates scripting.** Every page
  ships its Scene to the main-thread GPU owner whether or not it is scripted. So
  scripting does not worsen it. Cure it independently: encode the Scene as a flat,
  pointer-free buffer and *transfer* the `ArrayBuffer` (zero-copy ownership move)
  instead of structured-cloning it; ship incremental damage (band-scroll +
  per-tile generation cache already exist host-side); use SAB in the PWA lane. The
  flat encoder already exists and the per-frame cost is measured small (see §5a).
- **One wire discipline serves both seams.** Both want a flat, position-independent
  representation (the component ABI forbids object graphs anyway). A single
  flat-buffer format makes the Scene transferable *and* the component copy a single
  contiguous memcpy. The mere-side `ContentUpdate` byte envelope is now in that
  family: same flat-buffer discipline, still a separate schema from D-doc's
  canonical-ABI payload. Shared
  serialization *technique* (flat buffers), separate *channels*: the Scene payload
  (paths / glyphs / clips) and the component-ABI payload (DOM mutations / events) are
  unrelated, so they share the toolchain, never the schema.

Do **not** fuse the two seams into one hop. They serve different purposes (one is
the isolation boundary, one is the thread boundary). Make each cheap in its own
idiom: co-locate so the isolation hop is a memcpy, transfer so the thread hop is
zero-copy.

## 5a. Measured: the Scene encoder already exists, and per-frame cost is small (2026-06-29)

Grounding the §5 bet against the code. `netrender::Scene` is a flat op list
(`Vec<SceneOp>` + a font / transform / image palette) and **already derives serde**,
shipping `snapshot_postcard` / `replay_postcard` (a position-independent binary) plus
JSON, behind netrender's `serde` feature. It was built for Roadmap A2 capture/replay,
but it is exactly the flat buffer the transfer path wants. So §5's "encode the Scene as
a flat buffer" is not greenfield work. The mere-side Rust transport is now landed:
meerkat enables netrender's `serde` feature, wraps `ContentUpdate` in a postcard
byte envelope, dedups Scene font/image bytes by id across frames, and selects the
transfer stream for `wasm32` builds
([transfer.rs](../crates/meerkat/src/content/transfer.rs) *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-link -->,
[actor.rs](../crates/meerkat/src/content/actor.rs) *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-link -->,
[constellation/mod.rs](../crates/meerkat/src/constellation/mod.rs) *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-link -->). The remaining
web gap is the real browser Worker backend around that envelope.

Measured on representative page bands (release, opt-level 3; the `serialize_cost`
test in `netrender/netrender/src/scene/mod.rs`, run with
`cargo test -p netrender --features serde --lib serialize_cost -- --nocapture`):

| scene | ops | clone | pc encode | pc decode | postcard | json |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| text band, ops only | 81 | 5µs | 41µs | 68µs | 40 KB | 146 KB |
| text band + 40KB font + 4 img | 85 | 7µs | 82µs | 129µs | 97 KB | 371 KB |
| heavy band, ops only | 401 | 29µs | 195µs | 313µs | 202 KB | 727 KB |
| heavy band + 40KB font + 4 img | 405 | 24µs | 227µs | 402µs | 258 KB | 952 KB |

Reading:

- **Per-frame encode is affordable.** A normal text band encodes in ~40µs / 40 KB; a
  heavy band in ~200µs / 200 KB. The transfer itself (ArrayBuffer ownership move) is
  zero-copy, so the encode *is* the whole web tax, a small fraction of a 16ms frame
  even on the heavy band (encode + decode ~0.5ms).
- **The asset palette, not the op list, drives size, and it re-ships every frame in a
  naive encode.** A 40 KB font roughly doubles the band's wire size. Fonts and images
  are amortizable (registered once, keyed by `Blob::id` / `ImageKey`); the op list
  (glyphs) is the genuine per-frame delta. The transfer path should send blob bytes
  only on first use and reference them by id after. The Scene already carries that id
  machinery ("subsequent frames may omit data for already-cached keys"). This, not
  faster encoding, is the real per-frame refinement.
- **postcard is ~3.6x smaller than JSON**, confirming postcard as the wire format.
- **Native pays none of this.** Clone is ~8x cheaper than encode, and on native the
  content actor and the kernel share an address space, so there is no serialize hop at
  all. Serialization is purely the cross-Worker (web) cost.

So §5 holds and sharpens: the encoder exists and is cheap; the Rust-side wire format
and asset-palette dedup are plumbing now, not research. The next measurement belongs
at the browser boundary: Worker startup/channel overhead and real
`postMessage(buffer, [buffer])` transfer behavior.

## 6. The web build budget

The feared three-axis matrix ({threaded vs fallback} × {jco-component vs not} ×
{std vs no_std guest}) collapses, because two axes are not host-build multipliers:

- **jco component support is not SAB-gated.** Transpiled core wasm runs
  single-threaded on the baseline engine, so it rides both web builds.
- **std vs no_std is a per-extension property + a host capability policy**, not a
  Mere artifact (D-doc P0 finding: a std guest imports the WASI world and must be
  granted it; a no_std guest carries only its declared capabilities).

What remains:

| Build | Target | Toolchain | Threads | jco components |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **native** | desktop (pelt) | stable | native OS threads | n/a (native Wasmtime) |
| **web-baseline** | open-web + non-isolated PWA | stable | off (sequential fallback) | yes (single-threaded) |
| **web-threaded** | cross-origin-isolated PWA | **nightly + -Zbuild-std + atomics + shared-memory link** | SAB Web Workers | yes (single-threaded) |

- **3 builds, 2 toolchains.** The only expensive CI burden is the nightly
  std-rebuilding lane for the one threaded web artifact, which P-doc already owns.
- **Runtime selection** picks web-baseline vs web-threaded via
  `wasm-feature-detect threads()` and the presence of COOP/COEP. Threading and
  off-main-thread are the same move (the Rayon-driving wasm must live in a Worker;
  the main thread may never `Atomics.wait`).
- **Per-extension** is a separate, smaller table: each DocumentScript component is
  its own artifact, built once by its author (std or no_std); the host runs a
  capability-policy table (which profiles + whether the WASI floor is granted) per
  trust tier. This is D-doc §10.4 / §10.5 territory, not core CI.

---

## 7. What to measure / decide next

- **The flat transferable Scene** (cost #1): **Rust-side transport landed.** The
  `Scene` encoder exists (netrender postcard), meerkat enables it, `ContentUpdate`
  has a postcard byte envelope, Scene asset bytes are sent once by id, and the host
  selects the transfer stream for `wasm32`. Remaining work: the actual browser Worker
  actor backend around `postMessage(buffer, [buffer])`, plus measuring that boundary.
- **Cost #2 per turn** on native and web (jco): memcpy of a representative
  mutation batch through the canonical ABI. Confirm the per-turn batched contract
  keeps it negligible next to relayout.
- **The capability-policy table** (D-doc §10.4): how a grant becomes a linking
  decision (stubbed vs unlinked import), and the std-WASI-floor question per trust
  tier (D-doc §10.5 runtime-sharing tension).
- **The web-threaded artifact** stays an opt-in, app-lane-only experiment behind
  feature detection plus a homogeneous-core check (P-doc lever c). It is never the
  baseline, for engine cascade or in-script threads alike.
