# Scenograph Expansion Brief

**Date**: 2026-08-10
**Status**: research brief, commissioned by Mark: scenes, arrangements, and
backdrops need thorough, organized expansion and broad utility, for woodshed
before it releases and broadly ("we're not using even 10% of our capabilities
in that regard"). The brief organizes the space so generalization arrives
prepared rather than improvised. Every lane keeps the family's proven
standard: a question is answered by the consumer that forces it, and unforced
surface does not ship.

## 1. Where the family stands

- **0.0.3 is published; 0.0.4 is the current development line**: sceno (instance identity, footprints,
  transforms, `contains`, open emphasis channels), scenomise (solve/relax),
  scenotime (epoch/revision identity, diff, snapshot, default pick),
  scenograph facade. 45 family tests.
- **Consumers**: mere by path; isometry and turnstone by git (branch `main`);
  `ports/graphshell` including the remote client, which is the standing proof
  that scenes cross a wire to a viewer with no source access.
- **Loose ends the 0.0.3 release recorded** (**re-checked 2026-08-18**): the
  isometry and turnstone re-resolves are **closed, and were never actually
  outstanding** — both lock `sceno` 0.0.3, `cargo update -p sceno` moves zero
  packages, and both compile green, because a git dep on branch `main`
  followed the release without anyone acting. Woodshed did get the
  notification (its stage-set plan carries a 2026-08-10 gate-is-open banner)
  but **depends on no scenograph crate at all**, so L1 is a founding rather
  than a re-resolve, and it is the whole of the remaining gate.
- **The leverage reading.** The family proved contract discipline: unused
  surface was deleted, additions were forced through consumers. What it has
  not yet proven is breadth of use. One projection style is consumed (graph
  canvas), there is no environment layer, no motion, and snapshots serve as
  transport only. The 90% Mark is pointing at is real and enumerable.

## 2. Vocabulary: the stagecraft tiers

The family name promises a scenery workshop; today it ships placement. Three
tiers make the gaps addressable:

- **Scene** (portable result): placed instances, footprints, channels, routed
  relations, pick. sceno and scenotime own it.
- **Arrangement** (portable analytic core plus a larger local registry):
  `score::Arrangement` names Spiral, Grid, Geographic, and Hulls. Mere's local
  registry also carries Radial, Stack, Timeline, Columns, Penrose, Fractal,
  Semantic Embedding, and Spectral.
- **Backdrop** (missing): the environment behind and beneath placed content.
  The word appears exactly once in the corpus (the orrery's background
  palette in the apparatus theme plan); every host paints its own background
  ad hoc, and nothing behind content can cross the wire, because the
  contract has no place for it.

**Product register (recorded 2026-08-18, Mark)**: above these contract
tiers, *scene* in product speech means a reusable total projection regime:
every lever (arrangement, backdrop, representations, motion, grammar) flexed
toward one intent, portable across datasets, obeying the orrery's laws. That
is the brand mark's "the projection decides what a node *is*" made a design
unit. The [content catalog](2026-08-18_scenograph_content_catalog.md) deck 2
holds that register; the contract's Scene type is what a regime emits when
applied to a dataset.

## 3. Lanes, each with its forcing consumer

### L1. Woodshed adoption (data founded; rendering open)

The stage-set plan's model is ready-made for the portable contract: the Set
projected as a graph (each staged Card occurrence a numbered node, Set order
a typed `Next` edge), one `RoutedRelation` per reason (diatonic, shared-tone,
voice-leading, practiced-after) per the cells-as-edges ruling, expansion
state on the projection, Card edits landing on the one Set. The re-resolve
half is closed (§1); what remains is the founding: woodshed takes its first
`sceno` dependency and builds Stage's projection through the `scene_out`
shape, sourced from `woodshed-graph` (the theory catalog already projected
into the chartulary graph, which is the Set's graph form). **Done when**
Stage renders a Set graph through the portable contract with fanned relations,
before woodshed's release.

**Founded 2026-08-18.** woodshed took its first `sceno` dependency;
[`StageGraphSnapshot`](../../../../woodshed/crates/woodshed-core/src/stage_scene.rs)
lives in Woodshed and
emits the Set as items plus fanned relations (10 module tests, 68 core tests,
workspace green). It was adapter-only work, because the finding on arrival
was that woodshed's own plan understated its state: `CardId`, `Set::graph()`,
and a 16-kind relation engine whose `relations_between` already returns
*every* reason for a pair were all landed, so no relation had to be derived.
The **data** half of the gate is met; the *rendering* half remains, a host
that draws and hit-tests fanned cells instead of one line per pair. One
boundary recorded for later: the relations lifted are formula-level and so
key-agnostic, which makes keyed relations (diatonic in, dominant of, resolves
to) a further slice, and the Stage projection is where they belong.

### L2. Backdrops - LANDED 2026-08-20

Isometry's map *is* a backdrop: a pixel-art VTT scene is mostly environment.
Woodshed's stage floor / fretboard context is the second. Graphshell remote
is the discipline: a backdrop must be scene data or a remote viewer sees
content floating on nothing. Research questions for the first slice: backdrop
as an item kind versus a separate table; layering (always behind, or
interleaved); whether `Region` generalizes or a new type is forced; hit
transparency (backdrops mostly never pick, except VTT maps that do, which is
what `hit` overrides are for). **Entrance gate**: prototype against
isometry's map and woodshed's stage; ship whichever shape both force,
nothing either fails to force.

**Ruling:** both consumers forced a separate backdrop table. A backdrop has
source provenance, a coordinate space, transform and footprint, an open
appearance kind, visibility, and collision participation. Backdrops paint in
table order behind graph content. They do not pick. A selectable VTT feature is
an item over the map, which preserves the existing `InstanceId` intent path.
Isometry uses the table for its authored board under selectable tiles;
Woodshed uses it for the Stage floor under cards. Graphshell renders the same
table remotely, and scenomise reads collidable entries as static placement
obstacles. Interleaving remains unmodeled because neither consumer needed it.

### L3. Portable arrangement choice and citation

The portable arrangement enum now exists, and mer3ly met the first-device gate
by sharing an arrangement choice in its URL-hash scene index. The remaining
question is the common citation format: a durable record that names the
reading, arrangement, and small authored delta across windows, devices, and
peers. Shelfmark records the proposed form but does not become a common format
until a second shipping consumer forces it.

### L4. Projection captures as documents

Scenotime snapshots already cross a wire; nothing stores one. A projection
capture as
an eidetic artifact yields projection save/restore, VTT session records
(isometry), shareable set lists (woodshed), and replay for the games wing.
Cheap because the encoding exists; the work is identity and retention, which
eidetic owns. **Entrance gate**: the first consumer that wants yesterday's
projection back.

### L5. Motion (the deepest of the 90%)

`scenotime::diff` computes what changed between snapshots, and every
consumer snaps. Tweening diff output (position, scale, opacity over host
time) is the largest experience upgrade per line of code available in the
family, and it belongs at the scenotime layer precisely so every consumer
(canvas, remote client, woodshed's rehearsal filmstrip) inherits it rather
than reimplementing it. Care: the host owns the clock, the same seam
discipline `mere-mesh-host` uses for `Clock`. **Entrance gate**: the first
continuous re-projection a consumer ships (rehearsal filmstrip or a canvas
projection switch, whichever lands first).

## 4. Method

Mark's framing is the method: the unexpected generalizations will come from
the content, so this brief's job is preparation, not invention. Each lane
names its forcing consumer up front; content-driven surprises get placed
against §2's tiers (is this scene, arrangement, or backdrop?) before any new
module ships. The 0.0.3 release plan's evidence standard stands.

## 5. Sequence

L1's data half is founded and its headed rendering half remains. L2 is closed
through Isometry, Woodshed, and Graphshell remote realization. L3's first-device proof is met, while the shared
shelfmark format waits for a second consumer. L4 opens on a
save-my-projection ask. L5 rides the first continuous reprojection. Published
0.0.3 remains historical; current work advances the versioned 0.0.4 line.
