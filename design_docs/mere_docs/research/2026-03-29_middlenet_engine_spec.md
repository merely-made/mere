## 1. What MiddleNet Is

**MiddleNet** names the protocol and content space that sits between smallnet and
the full modern web.

| Layer | Protocols / content types | Defining property |
|-------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Smallnet** | Gemini, Gopher, Finger, Spartan, Scroll, Nex | Intentionally minimal; no CSS, no JS, text-first |
| **MiddleNet** | RSS/Atom, static HTML, Markdown, simple interactive pages, reader-mode HTTP, smallnet protocols | Structured documents; moderate CSS; light or no JS |
| **Fullnet** | Modern web apps (React, SPAs, authenticated apps) | Full JS runtime, full browser API surface |

MiddleNet is not a new protocol. It is an **observation** about a class of
content that the modern browser treats as a lesser citizen (RSS, Gemini) or
strips down for reader mode, and that intentionally simple protocols like
Gemini deliberately target. A spatial browser that claims smallnet support
implicitly claims MiddleNet support, because the rendering concerns overlap.

MiddleNet content is characterised by:

- Documents and articles over applications
- Structure over interactivity
- Predictable layout over dynamic layout
- Protocols that fit in a single connection without persistent JS runtimes

## 1.1 Current Baseline and Phased Delivery

As of 2026-04-09, Graphshell already ships a meaningful **native desktop
Middlenet lane**, but it does **not** yet ship the extracted portable engine as
its own crate stack.

Current implementation reality:

- `viewer:middlenet` is already a real viewer route on native desktop beside
  `viewer:servo` and `viewer:wry`.
- Protocol-faithful adapters already exist for Gemini/gemtext, Gopher, Finger,
  RSS, Atom, JSON Feed, Markdown, and plain text, with Titan and Misfin helper
  surfaces for mutation and messaging.
- The first crate split is now real in the repository:
  `middlenet-core`, `middlenet-adapters`, `middlenet-render`, and a slimmed
  `middlenet-engine` facade all exist as workspace members.
- The canonical content model is now `SemanticDocument` plus provenance/trust/
  diagnostics metadata rather than the older `SimpleDocument`-only framing.
- The native `viewer:middlenet` surface now renders semantic documents through
  a Direct Lane render scene instead of the old Middlenet DOM/display-list
  scaffolding.
- Feed/article content is now a concrete first-class Direct Lane surface with
  preserved source/article links and raw-source visibility.
- WebFinger, NIP-05, Matrix, and ActivityPub actor resolution already feed a
  person-node model with cached provenance, freshness TTLs, and refresh UI.
- The extracted `middlenet-engine` / `graphshell-comms` split, browser/PWA
  envelopes, Boa/WIT integration, Wizer snapshotting, and reader-mode HTTP are
  still future phases rather than present repository facts.

This means the doc should be read as a **phased delivery target**:

1. **Phase 0: native baseline**.
   Graphshell continues shipping native desktop Middlenet adapters, viewer
   routing, person-node convergence, and selective Servo/Wry delegation.
2. **Phase 1: extraction boundary**.
   This phase is now partially landed: protocol/document adapters and the
   semantic core have moved into portable crates, while host plumbing and some
   compatibility seams remain in transition.
3. **Phase 2: portable document engine**.
   This phase is now partially landed on native desktop via the Direct Lane
   semantic/render path, but not yet across browser/PWA/WASI envelopes.
4. **Phase 3: browser/mobile envelopes**.
   Add host-aware degradation, browser transport policies, and co-op envelope
   decisions only after the extracted engine boundary is real.

---

## 2. The Portable MiddleNet Engine

The **portable MiddleNet engine** names the target WASM-compilable rendering
crate intended to serve MiddleNet content across all host envelopes. The
canonical crate name should be `middlenet-engine`. "Portable web core" remains
useful architecture prose for the shared boundary, but not the package name.

The current intended architecture is **lane-oriented**, not a single
"everything becomes HTML" funnel:

- a **Direct Lane** for canonical `SemanticDocument` content rendered through
  Parley and Vello
- an **HTML Lane** for actual HTML/CSS content, using Blitz's DOM/style/layout
  stack and Graphshell's WebRender fork
- a **Servo fallback lane** for full-web or higher-complexity content

That distinction matters for smallnet work. Protocols such as Gemini, Gopher,
Finger, feeds, Markdown, and Scroll should land first as protocol-faithful
document content, not as accidental HTML.

### 2.1 Core properties

These are **target properties for phases 2 and 3**, not claims about the
current extracted state of the Graphshell repository.

- **Fully targetable across native + browser WASM + WASI runtime hosts** —
  targets `wasm32-unknown-unknown` as the browser portability floor and
  `wasm32-wasip2` as the portable runtime/service floor for native WASM
  hosts. Native desktop builds remain native binaries. The goal is one
  codebase and one architectural core across these targets, not literally one
  identical binary.
- **Async compositing as architecture** — layout and paint never block on JS.
  CSS renders immediately; JS mutations arrive through a command buffer and are
  applied on the next compositor frame.
- **WASM memory snapshotting** — Wizer pre-initialises the engine (parsed
  default stylesheet, warm Boa context, initialised wgpu pipeline cache) and
  snapshots. Each page instantiates from a CoW copy in ~100μs, not ~50ms cold.
- **WIT component boundary** — JS engine is a separate WASM component. It
  communicates with the DOM via a typed WIT interface. JS engine can be swapped
  (Boa now, Nova later) without touching the renderer.
- **Tiered worlds** — different WIT worlds compile to different binary sizes:
  `middlenet:smallnet` (~3 MB, no JS), `middlenet:document` (~8 MB, basic JS),
  `middlenet:interactive` (~20 MB, fuller DOM surface).

### 2.3 Component crate sources

| Component | Source | WASM status |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| html5ever | crates.io (servo/html5ever) | ✅ pure Rust |
| Stylo | servo/servo (style crate) | ✅ with rayon disabled |
| Taffy | crates.io | ✅ pure Rust |
| Parley | linebender/parley | ✅ pure Rust |
| WebRender | mark-ik/webrender `wgpu-backend-0.68-minimal` | ✅ wgpu backend (complete); all 63 shaders translated to WGSL |
| wgpu | crates.io | ✅ WebGPU backend in WASM |
| Boa | crates.io (boa-dev/boa) | ✅ ships `boa_wasm` package (94% Test262) |
| wasmtime | bytecodealliance | ✅ for running page-level WASM content |
| tiny-skia | crates.io | ✅ software rasterizer fallback (SIMD128) |
| reqwest | crates.io | ✅ auto-detects WASM, uses browser Fetch |

The WebRender wgpu backend (mark-ik/webrender) is the critical path item for
the HTML lane. The Direct Lane remains intentionally lighter-weight and
protocol-first.

## 3. Protocol Rendering Strategy

### 3.1 Canonical document model first, HTML lane second

Following Lagrange's architecture and the newer lane split, MiddleNet should
parse smallnet and document protocols to the same **canonical semantic document
model** before rendering. That canonical model is not the same thing as the
HTML lane's DOM tree.

The current repository now implements the first real extraction of that
protocol-faithful adapter surface through `middlenet-core`,
`middlenet-adapters`, `middlenet-render`, and a facade-style
`middlenet-engine`, but it does not yet implement the fully extracted HTML lane
or the broader WASM host envelopes described below.

```
gemini://  → gemtext parser   ─┐
gopher://  → gopher parser    ─┤
finger://  → plain text       ─┤
spartan:// → Spartan parser   ─┤
scroll://  → scroll parser    ─┼→ SemanticDocument → Direct Lane → Parley/Vello
nex://     → nex parser       ─┤
misfin:    → misfin parser    ─┤
feeds/md   → format parsers   ─┘

text/html  → html5ever / blitz-html → Blitz DOM + Stylo + Taffy → HTML Lane → WebRender
```

This means the engine has one canonical semantic-document spine for
protocol-faithful sources and a separate richer HTML/CSS lane when the source
is actually HTML or an explicit archive/export surface calls for it.

### 3.2 Capability model and adapter split

The broader smolnet research now points toward a transport-plus-format split:

- `middlenet-transport` owns request/response framing, status models, and
  transport realization families
- `middlenet-formats` owns content grammars such as gemtext, scrolltext,
  gopher menus, feeds, Markdown, and faithful-source text
- `middlenet-adapters` composes the two and emits streamed `DocumentDelta`
  updates into the lane system

This is a better long-term fit than treating every named protocol as a wholly
new stack. It lets Graphshell grow by capability family rather than by a pile
of bespoke protocol modules.

### 3.3 Document model mappings

Each protocol parser maps its native semantics to the canonical document model
while preserving protocol-authored meaning:

| Protocol | Canonical document-model mapping |
|---|---|
| Gemini gemtext | heading, paragraph, link, code/preformatted, and list-like blocks |
| Gopher menu | menu/link blocks plus faithful-source fallback for ambiguous or ASCII-art-heavy bodies |
| Finger | plain text body with minimal structure |
| Spartan | Gemini-adjacent document blocks plus request/input semantics |
| Scroll | section-oriented `scrolltext`, input links, link relations, BCP47/language-aware metadata, and UDC-bearing response metadata |
| Nex | directory/link-list plus file/plain-text blocks |
| Misfin | gemtext-adjacent message body plus message metadata and mailbox semantics |
| RSS/Atom | feed/document-entry blocks with time, authorship, and link metadata |
| JSON Feed | feed/document-entry blocks with time, authorship, and link metadata |
| Markdown | heading/paragraph/link/code/list blocks |

The important invariant is that the canonical document model preserves source
semantics first. HTML rendering exists, but it is not the default meaning of a
smallnet document.

### 3.4 Scroll as a first-class Middlenet target

Scroll deserves explicit mention in the engine spec because it lines up with
Graphshell unusually well.

Based on the provided specification, Scroll combines:

- `text/scroll` as a distinct streamable source format
- section-oriented document structure rather than mere heading decoration
- first-class metadata requests returning scrolltext abstracts
- BCP47 language negotiation at request time
- UDC-coded success responses and UDC-aware document worldview
- Titan adjacency and Gemini-like certificate posture

This makes Scroll more than "Gemini but slightly richer." It is a strong fit
for Graphshell's protocol-faithful document lane and for Verse's UDC-aware
indexing model. If Scroll support lands, Middlenet SHOULD preserve:

- section hierarchy
- heading-number-derived local navigation targets
- author/publish/modify metadata
- language negotiation metadata
- UDC class information
- link relations
- input-link semantics
- metadata abstracts as preview material

### 3.5 Gopher conversion: heuristic with faithful fallback

Gopher menus are converted to the document model using heuristic detection
(identifying link lines, info lines, preformatted blocks from ASCII art).
Characters that would be misread by the document model are escaped.

A per-node user preference disables conversion and renders the raw Gopher
source as monospace preformatted text. This is the same behaviour Lagrange
exposes as "disable Gopher menu styling autodetection."

### 3.6 Faithful render plus optional assistive enrichment

Graphshell's accessibility and protocol policy should be:

- render Gemini, Gopher, gemtext, feeds, Markdown, and other source grammars
  **as themselves**,
- preserve the protocol's authored shape rather than silently replacing it with
  richer proprietary semantics,
- add optional assistive structure **on top** of that faithful render when it
  materially improves orientation, comprehension, or accessibility.

Simple protocols are not inherently less accessible than HTML, but they do
push more responsibility onto the client. For Graphshell that means optional
layers such as:

- heading and outline summaries,
- section/action inventories,
- speech-friendly or low-distraction views,
- alt-text and preformatted-block handling,
- graph-aware provenance and "why is this here?" assistive summaries.

This also preserves the current authored-content boundary:

- **Markdown** remains Graphshell's default inward-facing authored format for
  notes, annotations, and lightweight shared documents.
- **HTML** may become a richer long-term authored/publication surface later,
  but that would be an explicit architectural shift, not an accidental drift
  caused by how browsed content is rendered.

### 3.7 Security preference hierarchy

The engine defaults to the secure protocol where there is meaningful overlap:

- Discovery: WebFinger (HTTPS) preferred over Finger (plaintext)
- Upload/submit: Titan (TLS) preferred over Spartan (plaintext) for equivalent actions
- Modern document: Gemini (TLS) preferred over Spartan (plaintext) for equivalent content

Where protocols are not actually interchangeable, Graphshell should choose by
source semantics rather than by "upgrade" instinct alone. Scroll, for example,
should not be silently downgraded into generic Gemini rendering just because
the transport family is adjacent.

For protocols with no secure analogue (Gopher, Nex, Finger, Guppy): render
faithfully. Show the protocol name and plaintext nature as a neutral
informational indicator — not an alarm. Warn on encryption *failures*
(untrusted or expired certificates), not on encryption *absence*.

### 3.8 Packaging and ownership boundary

The MiddleNet engine owns shared document-model adapters and rendering
semantics. It does **not** own transport realization.

- `middlenet-engine` owns document/render adapters, lane selection, and the
  canonical semantic document model.
- `graphshell-comms` or equivalent portable protocol logic owns protocol byte
  parsing/composition.
- Hosts and native mods own raw sockets, TLS sessions, browser APIs, server
  listeners, and other host-specific runtime capabilities.

Default vs optional protocol packaging is governed by
[`2026-03-30_protocol_modularity_and_host_capability_model.md`](2026-03-30_protocol_modularity_and_host_capability_model.md) *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-link -->.

---

## 4. MiddleNet Protocol Coverage

The long-term engine target surface is below. Current Graphshell coverage today
is strongest in Gemini/Gopher/Finger, RSS/Atom/JSON Feed, Markdown/plain text,
WebFinger, and the Titan/Misfin person workflows; Spartan, Nex, Guppy,
reader-mode HTTP, and browser-host execution remain planned.

### Tier 0 — Smallnet and adjacent text-first documents (no JS required)

- **Gemini** (`gemini://`) — gemtext; TLS; primary modern secure document lane
- **Gopher** (`gopher://`) — menu/text; heuristic conversion; faithful-source mode
- **Finger** (`finger://`) — plain text profile; WebFinger preferred for identity discovery
- **Titan** — TLS upload extension to Gemini; shared upload dialog with Spartan
- **Misfin** — TLS messaging; `text/gemini` + message line types; social/contact lane
- **Spartan** — plaintext Gemini-adjacent; lightweight request/submit semantics
- **Scroll** (`scroll://`) — `text/scroll`; streamable section-oriented document protocol; BCP47 language negotiation; metadata abstracts; UDC-coded success responses
- **Nex** — plaintext directory/document; Gemini-style link listings
- **Guppy** — UDP plaintext; low priority; compatibility/experiment only

### Tier 1 — Document web (no JS required)

- **RSS / Atom / JSON Feed** — feed parsing and article list rendering
- **Static HTML** — blogs, docs, wikis, forums (HTML + CSS, no JS)
- **Markdown / plain text** — direct rendering
- **`data:` URIs** — inline document rendering

### Tier 2 — Light interactive (Boa JS)

- **Simple HTTP/HTTPS** — static sites with basic JS (navigation menus,
  collapsibles, form validation, `fetch`-based content loading)
- **Reader-mode HTTP** — article extraction from any HTTP page, re-rendered
  with the engine's own layout
- DOM APIs required: `querySelector`, `addEventListener`, `classList`,
  `setAttribute`, `createElement`, `appendChild`, `fetch`, `setTimeout`,
  `requestAnimationFrame`

### Out of scope (Fullnet — host browser handles this)

- Modern SPAs (React, Vue, Svelte)
- Authenticated web apps
- WebGL / Canvas-heavy content
- Streaming media
- Service workers, WebSockets at application level

---

## 4. Host Envelope Roles

The engine's role differs per envelope. **Only the native desktop role exists
today.** The other envelopes are target roles once extraction, host capability
seams, and browser-envelope policy decisions are complete.

### Native desktop

The engine runs as a native library (compiled natively from the same source,
no WASM overhead). It is `viewer:middlenet` in the viewer registry — a third
render mode alongside `viewer:servo` (full web) and `viewer:wry` (OS overlay).

The user can route any node to any viewer. Smallnet URLs are routed to the
MiddleNet engine by default. HTTP URLs can go to Servo (full fidelity), the
MiddleNet engine (reader mode / light interactive), or Wry (OS webview).

### Browser extension

The host browser handles all HTTP/HTTPS rendering natively (it is the webview).
The MiddleNet engine runs as a WASM component inside the extension's service
worker or side panel context. Its role is narrow:

- Render smallnet content (`gemini://`, `gopher://`, `finger://`) in the side
  panel or a controlled tab — the host browser cannot do this
- Render RSS/Atom feeds in the side panel
- Optionally render reader-mode extractions from HTTP pages

Web content opens in native browser tabs. The graph is the navigation memory
and launcher; the host browser is the webview.

### Browser tab / PWA

Same as extension but with weaker host capabilities (no `chrome.tabs`, limited
storage). The engine runs entirely in WASM inside the page. Smallnet and
document rendering work; network requests go through the browser's `fetch`.
Full web rendering is the surrounding browser page itself.

### Mobile (iOS / Android)

The engine may eventually run via a WASM runtime, but the primary assumption is
still a native mobile host build around the same portable core. Platform-provided
webview (WKWebView / Android WebView) handles full web; the engine handles
smallnet and MiddleNet document lanes.

### Native WASM runtime / service host

`wasm32-wasip2` is best understood here, not as the default desktop app format.

This target is for:

- headless or helper processes,
- embeddable document/protocol components,
- protocol servers and inbox/listener surfaces,
- storage/index/archive workers,
- async graph update services,
- test and harness runtimes,
- future standalone service-style hosts such as `graphshell-server`

This is the target that makes "portable runtime with sockets/filesystem-like
capabilities" meaningful. It is a complement to native desktop and browser
WASM, not a replacement for either.

---

## 5. Async Compositing Contract

The engine guarantees that **layout and paint never block on JS**:

```
HTTP response arrives (streaming)
  ↓
html5ever parses incrementally
  ↓
Stylo resolves styles for available nodes
  ↓
Taffy computes layout
  ↓
WebRender paints → wgpu texture              ← user sees content
  ↓  (concurrent, non-blocking)
Boa evaluates <script> tags
  ↓
DOM mutations queued in command buffer
  ↓
Next compositor frame applies mutations → repaint
```

Pages that are CSS-only (Tier 0 and 1) paint at full speed with no JS cost.
JS-enhanced pages (Tier 2) degrade gracefully: content appears, then
interactivity arrives. The user never waits for JS to see the page.

---

## 6. Snapshotting Strategy

Three snapshot levels are useful:

1. **Engine snapshot** — Wizer snapshot of the fully initialised engine
   (parsed UA stylesheet, Boa builtins, wgpu pipeline cache, empty DOM).
   Produced at build time. All page instances CoW-instantiate from this.

2. **Framework snapshot** — Boa context with a specific JS framework
   pre-evaluated (e.g., common polyfills, Preact runtime). Produced on first
   use, cached. Pages using that framework start warm.

3. **Page snapshot** — Full WASM linear memory snapshot of a rendered page
   (DOM, JS heap, layout cache). Used for back/forward navigation. Only the
   dirty pages from the engine snapshot are stored — typically tens of KB for
   document pages.

## 7. Relation to the Verso Mod

The existing Verso mod provides `viewer:servo` (Servo + WebRender/GL) and
`viewer:wry` (OS webview overlay). These are native-only, process-coupled, and
cover fullnet.

Today Graphshell operates as a native desktop application with `viewer:middlenet`,
`viewer:servo`, and `viewer:wry` routing inside the same repository. The
portable MiddleNet engine described here is therefore still an extraction and
host-portability project, not a completed subsystem boundary.

The MiddleNet engine is a separate concern:

| Property | Verso (Servo/Wry) | MiddleNet engine |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Target | Fullnet (HTTP/HTTPS, full JS) | MiddleNet (smallnet + document + light interactive) |
| WASM-compilable | No | Yes |
| JS engine | SpiderMonkey (full) | Boa (interpreter, 94% Test262) |
| CSS engine | Stylo (full, parallel) | Stylo (single-threaded) |
| Renderer | WebRender / GL | WebRender / wgpu |
| Host envelopes | Native desktop only | All envelopes |
| Scope | Browser-grade web fidelity | Document-grade MiddleNet fidelity |

They are complementary. On native desktop, both are available; the viewer
registry routes content to the appropriate engine by URL scheme and content
type. In extension/PWA/mobile envelopes, only the MiddleNet engine is available.

## 8. Open Questions

1. **Crate naming** — use `middlenet-engine` for the portable
  document/render crate. Keep `graphshell-core` for the identity/authority
  kernel, and keep "portable web core" as descriptive architecture language
  rather than the Cargo package name.
2. **WebRender wgpu backend readiness** — the render pass wiring (alpha/opaque/
   composite dispatch) and WASM surface integration are the critical path for
   the HTML lane. The Direct Lane should remain independently useful via its
   own lighter-weight renderer for Tier 0/1 protocol-faithful content.
3. **Smallnet server integration** — Gemini/Gopher/Finger servers currently
   live in the Verso native mod. Whether these move into the portable engine
   (client-only, server stays native) or stay in Verso is an open placement
   question.
4. **Reader-mode extraction** — Tier 2 HTTP reader mode requires a content
   extraction step (similar to Firefox Reader View / Readability.js). This
   should be a Rust implementation inside the engine, not a JS library, to
   keep the extraction WASM-portable and JS-free.

*The MiddleNet engine is the portable answer to "what does Graphshell render
when it has no OS webview and no full browser engine?" The current codebase
already covers much of the protocol-faithful document lane natively; the
remaining work is to extract, phase, and host that lane without giving up
faithful render or the Markdown-vs-HTML authored-content boundary.*
