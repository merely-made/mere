# The agent harness (the run loop for models/agents)

**Date**: 2026-07-03
**Status**: Design brief. No code proposed. Binds the layer between two seams that already
exist: the model runtime seam (the [local models harness brief](2026-06-24_local_models_harness_brief.md))
and the typed actuation seam (the D7 agent harness in
[`meerkat/src/agent_harness.rs`](../../../crates/meerkat/src/agent_harness.rs) *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-link -->). Neither owns
the loop that puts a model behind the actions. This doc is that loop.

**Related (the agentic lane):**

- [local models harness brief](2026-06-24_local_models_harness_brief.md) — `InferenceProvider` /
  `AdapterLoader`, backends by target, the inference actor. The brain seam. This doc consumes it.
- [system diagnostics plan, D7](../implementation_strategy/2026-06-08_system_diagnostics_and_accessibility_plan.md) —
  the landed typed harness: `AgentObservation` (surfaces, enabled actions, diagnostics, a11y) +
  `AgentAction` incl. the by-id `Invoke(String)` registry seam. The hands seam. This doc consumes it.
- [command registry plan](../../archive_docs/2026-09-02_retired_plans/2026-06-21_command_registry_configurable_menus_plan.md) —
  the one action id-space (palette, omnibar, a11y, harness). The tool vocabulary.
- [mcp_native_graph plan](../implementation_strategy/2026-06-26_mcp_native_graph_plan.md) — the
  external boundary, both directions. Expose rides the registry; consume is a tool ring here.
- [knot plan, agent nodes](../../archive_docs/2026-08-06_completed_plans/2026-06-24_djot_editor_knot_nodes_plan.md) —
  the durable home of a standing agent: a node whose body is its policy, whose edges are its
  materialized results.
- [geist models brief](2026-05-10_geist_models_brief.md) — the model architecture (base + adapter
  engrams). A geist is what sits behind the provider; this doc does not re-derive it.
- [capability gate catalogue](2026-05-14_capability_gate_catalogue_brief.md) +
  [persona model brief](2026-05-14_persona_model_brief.md) — the gate spine and the scope axis.
- [operator presence overlay plan](../implementation_strategy/2026-06-25_operator_presence_overlay_plan.md) —
  the agent as one of the three operator sources; a run renders presence ("watch your AI think").

## 1. The gap

The lane has a brain seam and a hands seam, and both are the right shape:

- **Brain**: `InferenceProvider` (text in, streamed tokens out, capability-matched backends,
  stub-first). Scoped, unbuilt.
- **Hands**: the D7 harness (landed, feature-gated, tested). A compact typed observation, a small
  action vocabulary routed through host methods, `Invoke(id)` over the registry, results with
  blocked/degraded reasons.

What neither owns: the loop that assembles context, calls the model, parses a tool call, gates it,
dispatches it, records what happened, and goes around again. The MCP plan calls this "the agent
runtime" and defers it; the D7 plan stops at "let a Gemma-class model sit behind that typed loop"
without saying how. This doc says how.

---

## 2. The loop

One run = one armillary actor (the fetch/sync/Athanor shape; off the UI thread, a real live op in
Steward, stoppable through the existing `StopFocusedOperation` path). Per turn:

1. **Assemble context**: the current `AgentObservation`, RAG retrieval over capability-scoped
   engrams (persona/moot scope, per the persona brief), the agent's own policy body (for a
   standing agent node), and the transcript so far.
2. **Infer**: hand the assembled prompt to the `InferenceProvider`; stream tokens back as actor
   messages. Steward shows real status (turn count, current action, budget remaining), never a
   placebo spinner.
3. **Act**: parse the model's output into the internal call representation (§3), gate-check it,
   dispatch it, observe the result (the D7 `AgentStep` already returns result + fresh
   observation), append both to the transcript.
4. **Stop** when the model declares done, an action is blocked and the policy says defer to the
   user, or the budget (turns/tokens) runs out. Every terminal state is recorded in the run
   engram (§4) with its reason.

The loop is deliberately dumb: scheduling, retries, and streaming shape are actor-framework
concerns; capability checks live in the gate spine; the tool catalog lives in the registry. The
harness owns sequencing, transcript, and budget, and nothing else.

---

## 3. One tool vocabulary

The commitment: **the model's tool list is the observation's `enabled_actions`, rendered as
schemas.** Palette, menus, a11y, the MCP server, and the model all address the same registry ids.
There is never a parallel "agent tools" catalog to drift out of sync.

Three rings, one representation:

- **Registry actions** (in-app): `Invoke(id)` plus the typed D7 actions. Enablement, labels, and
  ids come from the observation, so the model only sees actions that are currently invokable.
- **Graph reads** (context): scoped node/subgraph/query reads, the same read surface the MCP
  expose half plans to offer as resources. Read scope is a capability, not a prompt convention.
- **Outbound MCP** (external): the consume half of the MCP plan, surfaced to the model as more
  tools in the same list, gated per server.

Internally a tool call is one enum shaped like `AgentAction` plus the read and MCP variants.
Per-provider adapters translate: an API model's native structured tool-calling maps directly; a
small local model gets a strict JSON grammar over the same ids, validated, with a rejected parse
returned to the model as a turn result rather than crashing the run (illustrative shape only; no
signatures proposed here).

---

## 4. Runs are graph material

A run is an engram: transcript, actions taken, results, terminal state, provider/adapter identity
(which geist, which backing model). Every mutation the run performs asserts a provenance edge
pointing at the run, per the borrowed-ideas rule the MCP plan already adopts
(assert-on-every-agent-mutation). Audit and undo fall out of the existing machinery instead of
needing an agent-specific log.

Two mutation postures:

- **Direct, gated**: small actions dispatch through the registry with per-action gating, exactly
  as if the user had invoked them, plus the provenance edge.
- **Proposal/apply**: batch or heavy mutations follow the Athanor split
  ([alembic plan](../implementation_strategy/2026-06-24_alembic_implementation_plan.md)): the run
  emits a changeset engram; adoption is a separate, human, gated act.

The agent node is the durable policy; runs are events under it. An interactive session's run
hangs off the session instead. Either way the transcript is queryable graph history, not app
state.

---

## 5. Two duty cycles, one loop

- **Interactive session**: summoned (omnibar `>` verb or a command), user present, chat-shaped.
  User presence is the consent context: gated actions can prompt per-action. Lean: the session is
  a node from its first turn (consistent with representations carrying node identity), and its
  transcript renders wherever the host puts conversation surfaces; the exact surface (comms
  thread, gloss card, dedicated pane) is a host choice and a user setting, not bound here.
- **Standing agent**: an agent node whose policy body defines trigger (graph signal, schedule,
  manual poke) and scope. No user present, so the posture tightens: pre-granted scoped
  capabilities only, mutations default to proposal/apply, results materialize as the node's
  edges with provenance. This is the Tinderbox-agent-made-spatial from the knot plan, with the
  loop behind it.

Same loop, same transcript shape, same gates; only trigger and consent posture differ. A run in
either cycle emits operator presence (the agent is one of the three operator sources), so watching
an agent work is the presence overlay, not a new UI.

---

## 6. Remote models are a provider, not an architecture

The local models brief binds local runtimes. One extension, stated here so it lands in the seam
and not around it: a remote API model (Claude-class, or any hosted endpoint) is just another
`InferenceProvider` backend over HTTPS, reachable from wasm and native alike. Capability
descriptors already carry context window and loader identity; a remote backend adds an endpoint +
credential, gated like any other outbound capability. Local vs. remote becomes provider choice
per agent, a user setting, with the same loop, transcript, gates, and provenance either way.

---

## 7. wasm vs native

The loop itself is portable: it is sequencing + data, no OS surface. The split it inherits is the
brain's (the local models brief §4: in-browser = RAG + small-model inference via Burn-wgpu;
heavier runtimes native) plus remote providers everywhere. The hands seam is host-provided, so
the browser lane's harness exposes whatever action surface that host has (the orrery browser lane
has a smaller registry than meerkat; the loop does not care).

---

## 8. Where it lives

Lean: a portable crate owning the loop, transcript/run types, the internal call representation,
and the provider adapters, with a host-adapter trait for the observation/action surface that
meerkat implements over its existing D7 harness. The D7 code stays host-side (panes and dividers
are host concepts); the loop never imports a host. Candidate homes: a sibling to the brief's
proposed `intel/llm`, or a standalone `agent` crate beside `armillary` (it is closer to an actor
pattern than to statistics). Settle at first-slice time; the constraint that matters is the
dependency direction (host implements the trait, loop stays host-free).

---

## 9. First slice (no model required)

Extends the local models brief's slice 1 with the loop, all testable with stubs:

1. **The call representation + registry rendering**: `enabled_actions` → tool schemas, parse +
   validate a call, reject a malformed one as a turn result. Pure functions, unit-tested.
2. **The loop actor with a scripted stub provider**: a deterministic provider that emits a canned
   action sequence (the `hashed` pattern, agent-shaped) driving the real D7 harness in meerkat:
   open Apparatus, switch theme, select a node, report diagnostics. The D7 done-condition,
   finally exercised by a "model."
3. **Run engram + provenance**: persist the transcript as a typed engram; a stub-run mutation
   asserts its provenance edge. Proves audit before any real model exists.

After that, the first real brain is whichever provider lands first (remote API or Burn-wgpu
small model), and it slots in with no loop changes. Interactive-session surface and standing-agent
triggers come after the loop is proven, as their own slices.

## 10. Owned elsewhere

- **Model architecture, adapters, governance**: geist brief.
- **Runtime backends, training, wasm inference ceiling**: local models harness brief.
- **MCP transport/auth and the exposed tool split**: mcp_native_graph plan.
- **Agent-node authoring UX** (the `=query` promotion, editor): knot plan.
- **Presence rendering + agent-transparency grants**: operator presence overlay plan.
- **Marketplace/compute**: communal-compute + resource-coordination briefs.

---

## 11. Open questions

- **Constrained decode for small local models.** API models emit structured calls natively; a
  Gemma-class model via Burn-wgpu needs grammar-constrained decoding (logit masking) or
  validate-and-retry over the strict JSON grammar. Lean validate-and-retry first (cheap, provider-
  agnostic); constrained decode is a Burn-side follow-up once a real local model is wired.
- **Context budget policy.** How much observation + RAG + transcript fits a small model's window;
  what gets summarized vs dropped. Empirical, per-provider, rides the capability descriptor.
- **Standing-agent triggers.** Graph signals vs schedule vs both; where trigger evaluation runs
  (the signals layer is the natural home). Settle when standing agents are built, after the loop.
- **The interactive surface.** Comms thread vs gloss card vs pane; a user setting per the
  configurability doctrine, but the default needs picking when the session slice lands.
- **Multi-agent.** Runs spawning runs (an agent invoking another agent node) is representable
  (a run engram pointing at a child run) but deliberately unbound here; revisit once single runs
  are real.

## Progress

- 2026-07-03: Brief drafted from a design conversation with Mark ("a harness for models/agents,
  how should that look"). Grounded against the landed D7 harness code (`agent_harness.rs`:
  `AgentObservation` / `AgentAction::Invoke(id)` / `AgentStep` / `StopFocusedOperation`), the
  local models harness brief, the MCP plan, and the knot plan's agent nodes. Core commitments:
  one tool vocabulary (registry ids, never a parallel catalog), runs as provenanced graph
  material with the Athanor proposal/apply split for heavy mutations, two duty cycles over one
  loop, remote models as a provider choice inside the same seam. No code proposed.
