# G5: mere re-base onto chartulary — progress

**Date:** 2026-07-08
**Status:** graph adoption landed. mere's `Graph` now *is* a
`chartulary::Graph<Node, EdgePayload>` under the hood. Three steps are done: the node
capabilities, the edge capabilities, and the graph swap itself (all 284 kernel tests
green). What remains is history-over-spine and the analytics retarget. Canonical plan:
`2026-07-08_generic_graph_substrate_plan.md`.

## What landed (committed under 1fe6a82)

- **Step 0, the trait-API refinement (chartulary).** Re-basing a real foreign node
  surfaced that `Addressed::addresses` and `Labeled::tags` returned *borrowed slices
  of chartulary's own types* (`&[Address]`, `&[String]`). That fits the default
  `Container` (which stores exactly those) but not mere's `Node`, which holds
  `Vec<AddressClaim>` and `HashSet<String>`, neither of which can produce those
  slices. The traits now return **owned values** (`Vec<Address>`, `Vec<String>`,
  `Option<Address>`), so a node maps from its own storage. chartulary (15 tests) and
  scholia (5) stay green. This is the classic "the abstraction looked fine against
  its own default impl; the first foreign implementor found the leak" lesson.
- **mere's `Node` implements the capabilities (kernel).** A new
  `graph/chart.rs` implements `Identified` (id = `Uuid`), `Addressed` (address
  claims mapped to scheme-qualified `Address`es, primary first), and `Labeled`
  (title with the empty-is-none rule, tags from the set). Verified by a compile-time
  bound check and a runtime test (`cargo test -p kernel chart`, 2 tests). The
  browser-runtime facets (favicon, viewer routing, session restore, lifecycle) stay
  on `Node` and simply do not participate in the generic capabilities.
- **`ContentBearing` deliberately deferred.** mere addresses content through its own
  cache, not a `muniment` blob, so adopting `muniment::Hash` for node content is a
  later re-base step, not this one.

## Edge capabilities (committed under fc5b8db)

- **mere's `EdgePayload` implements `Classified` / `Predicated` (kernel).** The
  single-predicate helper picks an explicit statement or open predicate first, else
  the first recognized `SemanticSubKind`'s canonical `urn:chart:rel:*` IRI. A
  semantic edge joins the shared ring as an open predicate (so it projects to RDF); an
  experience-layer edge (Traversal, Containment, Arrangement, Imported) reports
  `RelationClass::app("mere", 0)` and stays private. This is the two-ring split
  realized on mere's real edge type.

## Graph adoption — the big invasive middle (committed 5918d70)

mere's `Graph.inner` is no longer a bare `petgraph::StableGraph`; it is a
`chartulary::Graph<Node, EdgePayload>`. The change:

- **The substrate owns topology and identity.** mere's hand-rolled `id_to_node`
  index is retired; chartulary's built-in `by_id` is the single identity index. Node
  add/remove route through `insert` / `remove` (which maintain the index); edge
  add/remove through `connect` / `disconnect`. Weight mutation uses `node_mut` /
  `edge_mut`.
- **Algorithms read through one seam.** chartulary grew a read-only
   [`inner()`](../../../chartulary/src/graph.rs) *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-link --> accessor returning the underlying
  `&StableGraph`, plus `contains_node` and `node_weights_mut`. mere's graph queries
  (shortest path, SCC, connectivity, structural iteration) run petgraph's own
  functions over `inner()`. Topology mutation cannot go through it (the borrow is
  immutable by design), so the identity index cannot drift.
- **Persistence untouched.** mere's rkyv `Archive`/`Serialize`/`Deserialize` for
  `Graph` delegate through `to_snapshot` / `from_snapshot` (`GraphSnapshot`), which
  never serialize `inner` directly. Swapping the field type left the on-disk format
  and the whole persistence path unchanged.
- **Proof.** All 284 kernel unit tests pass unchanged — snapshot round-trips,
  derivation, cross-graph copy, node history, fields/couplings, and the chart
  capability tests. The single-write-path revision boundary still holds (every
  mutator still bumps `revision`).

This is the load-bearing move of the two-layer vision: chartulary is the portable
topology-plus-identity engine; mere's `Graph` is the orrery wrapper that keeps its
app-specific sidecars (nav history, fields, couplings, import records, url index,
revision, session) around the substrate.

## Edit spine — the codicil-backed journal (this step)

mere's durable mutations already exist as a stream of `CapturedDelta`s (stable-id,
serializable), emitted through the capture hook as each live `GraphDelta` applies.
This step gives that stream its principled home over the substrate: a
`codicil::Codicil<CapturedDelta>`, wrapped as `graph::GraphJournal`.

- **The graph is the replay of the journal.** `GraphJournal::replay` rebuilds the
  graph by folding the log through `apply_graph_delta`; `replay_from(seq, &mut graph)`
  advances a checkpoint (a restored `GraphSnapshot`) by only the newer entries. Live
  editing and replay share `apply_graph_delta`, so they cannot diverge, proven by a
  test that builds a graph by live mutation and asserts a journal replay reconstructs
  it identically.
- **Why mere's own vocabulary, not chartulary's `GraphLog`.** chartulary's `GraphLog`
  is topology-only (insert/remove/connect/disconnect) with a read-only `graph()`, so
  it cannot express mere's in-place content edits (title, tags, body, navigation,
  traversal). mere keeps its rich `CapturedDelta` vocabulary and takes only codicil,
  the append-only log primitive, beneath it. This is the two-layer split at the log
  level: codicil is the portable primitive, mere's journal is the orrery's edit
  language over it.
- **Ordered, forkable, persistable.** A journal stamps a monotonic `Seq` (a durable
  cursor for replication and tail-replay), forks with provenance (the log-level mirror
  of a graph fork), and saves/loads whole through a muniment slot.
  `journal_capture_hook` installs a hook feeding a shared journal, the host's
  codicil-backed persistence path.
- **Proof.** Four tests green (record+replay, fork+diverge, muniment round-trip, and
  the live-vs-replay invariant); all 288 kernel tests pass. codicil and muniment were
  already in the tree via chartulary, so the direct deps add no new crates.

## What this proves

The generic substrate can hold mere's real web node. scholia's projector, being a
pure function of the traits, can already emit RDF for a `Graph<Node, ...>` with no
new projection code. The two-ring split, the fork lineage, and the RDF projection
all apply to mere's node the moment mere adopts `chartulary::Graph`.

## Host adoption + lineage on stemma (this step)

- **Host adoption of the journal.** meerkat's `graph_delta_log.rs` (the env-gated
  session delta logger, the one host consumer of the capture hook) now maintains and
  replays through a `GraphJournal` (the kernel spine type), not a raw `CapturedDelta`
  vec. The streaming `.postcardlog` file stays as the crash-safe transport: codicil's
  founding persistence rewrites the whole log per save, so per-delta streaming stays
  the durable path until codicil grows append-friendly, per-entry persistence (its own
  roadmap). The production snapshot-plus-persisted-tail model (crash recovery via
  `GraphSnapshot` checkpoint + journal tail) is the larger follow-on, a deliberate
  design touching session save/restore.
- **Lineage on stemma; node-lineage retired.** The kernel's nav-history authority
  (`graph/history.rs`'s `SharedNavigationMemory`) now sits on `stemma::Stemma`
  (`StemmaSnapshot`), not the in-tree MPL `node-lineage`. Because stemma is
  node-lineage promoted near-verbatim (`GraphMemory` → `Stemma`), the swap is aliased
  imports and the nav model, snapshot format, and every history test are unchanged
  (288 kernel tests pass). eidetic's `browsing::lineage` bridge migrated the same way,
  so `node-lineage` has zero consumers and the crate is removed from the workspace.

## Content-bearing nodes (this step)

mere's `Node` now implements `ContentBearing`, completing the node capability set
(Identified + Addressed + Labeled + ContentBearing; the edge has Predicated +
Classified). `content()` is the blake3 `muniment::Hash` of the node's inline authored
body (`Node::body`, a knot note's djot), the address that body would have in a muniment
`BlobStore`, computed with `Hash::of` (sync, no store needed). So a node names its
content's identity while the bytes still live inline. `media_type()` is the node's
`mime_hint`. A bare web tab with no authored body has no graph-owned content (its
fetched page lives in mere's cache, off the node). 289 kernel tests pass. This unlocks
scholia projecting content identity and the cross-vault content-addressing story.

## Analytics: signals genericized (this step)

signals (the graph-structural signal producer: degree / betweenness importance, Louvain
community, bridges, articulation points, Jaccard affinity) is now generic over a minimal
`TopologyView` seam (node keys + undirected neighbours) instead of mere's concrete
`Graph`. Every signal is pure topology, so this was a clean genericization. Both
`kernel::graph::Graph` and the generic `chartulary::Graph<N, E>` implement `TopologyView`,
so the same algorithms run on the browser's graph and any substrate graph, proven by a
test running degree / community / affinity / articulation on a `chartulary::Graph<Container,
Relation>`. chartulary grew `neighbors_undirected` (the one method it lacked). Existing
callers are unchanged (mere's `Graph` implements the seam). 24 signals tests pass.

aether does not genericize the same way, and that is a real finding, not a gap. aether is
field/force physics: it evaluates over node **positions** (view state mere keeps in the
cartography sidecar, not graph truth, and that chartulary deliberately does not model) and
over the Field / Coupling / field_ast primitives that live in `kernel::graph`. It makes no
topology queries on the graph at all. So aether's promotion path is extracting the
field-layer primitives (Field, Coupling, field_ast) into a portable crate, a distinct
field-system extraction, not "run it on the generic graph."

## numen — the field-layer extraction (this step)

The field-primitive definitions (the scalar/vector field AST, `Field` + extent +
lifecycle, `Coupling` + response vocabulary, `EdgePath`) moved out of `kernel::graph`
into a new portable crate, **numen** (MIT/Apache, WASM-clean, plain data). They had been
*inside* the kernel since the 2026-05-30 field-system decision ("fields are a third graph
primitive"); now that nodes and edges live in the portable substrate (chartulary), the
third primitive belongs at the same portable tier, not in mere's app kernel. Fields are
spatial (they read positions), so they correctly stay out of chartulary, which is
position-free; numen is their own substrate sibling.

The kernel depends on numen and re-exports the types, so every `kernel::graph::` path
stays stable (276 kernel tests unchanged; the field-layer's own 13 unit tests moved to
numen). aether takes its field types from numen instead of the kernel; it keeps a kernel
dependency only for the projection glue that authors fields into a live mere `Graph` (49
tests with `field-rhai`). So aether's field-evaluation core no longer depends on mere's
kernel: the field primitives are portable, and aether is portable over them.

## What remains

1. **Content bytes out-of-line (follow-on).** Move `Node::body` bytes into an actual
   `muniment::BlobStore` (store only the `Hash` on the node) and content-address fetched
   web pages that live in mere's cache. `ContentBearing` already names the identity; this
   moves the storage. A data-model migration, its own deliberate step.
2. **Production journal persistence (follow-on).** A persisted tail journal alongside the
   `GraphSnapshot` checkpoint for crash recovery, once codicil grows append-friendly
   persistence. A deliberate design, not a rush.
3. **Done-condition.** meerkat runs on the substrate graph with no behaviour change. The
   graph swap already meets this at the kernel level (289 tests unchanged); the remaining
   steps deepen the adoption rather than gate it.

The graph swap (the big invasive middle), the edit spine, host adoption, the lineage
migration, and content-bearing nodes are done. The remaining steps are additive
deepenings.
