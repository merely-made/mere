# Operator Presence — watching an agent (or a guest, or yourself) act in the graph

**Status:** design (2026-06-25). A live, ephemeral, multi-scale focus-presence overlay:
a colour-tagged ring around the node an operator is on, descending into the node to
highlight the document section they are reading. One "operator" abstraction with three
sources: an agent, a co-op guest, and you. The rendering half mostly exists; the new
piece is a small ephemeral presence channel. No presence code yet.

The seed: Zed lets you follow an agent's focus and watch it read your files. The same
should work in a graph-native browser, and it should be the *same* primitive as co-op
guest-operator presence and the same UI as the web-clip element inspector.

## The idea: one operator, three sources, two scales

An **operator** is an identity with a colour, a current focus, and a short trail of recent
focus. Three kinds, one model:

- an **agent** (an armillary actor running a geist) whose colour rings the node it is
  accessing,
- a **co-op guest** (a remote persona) whose persona colour rings the node they are reading,
- **you**, the same model seen from inside.

Presence is **multi-scale**, which is the deepening that makes it more than a dot on a map:

- **Graph scale:** a colour-tagged ring (a cartography overlay) around the focused node.
- **Into the node:** descend to the node's document and highlight the specific div /
  section the operator is on (its a11y element, painted at its rect).

Following focus descends scales: the ring leads you to the node, the highlight shows you
the passage. The camera can follow, the way Zed follows a collaborator, so you watch an
agent walk the graph halo by halo and then watch its attention move down the page.

## Why this is mostly already rendered

- **Node-ring overlay (built).** The orrery has a cartography `Overlay` channel:
  `ClusterHalo { members }` haloes each community in its colour, `BridgeEmphasis` bolds
  structural brokers. The overlays are **position-independent** (they carry node
  references and a colour; each consumer paints them at its own positions, so the orrery,
  the gloss lens, and the minimap all show them). A presence ring is one more variant,
  `OperatorFocus { operator, colour, node }`, fed by a different signal.
- **The agent already has a focus (built).** [`agent_harness.rs`](../../../crates/meerkat/src/agent_harness.rs) *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-link -->
  exposes `AgentObservation { focused_node, surfaces (focused: bool), a11y, … }`, the same
  semantic state Apparatus and the a11y projection consume. The agent tracks what it is
  looking at already, so emitting its focus is surfacing a field it already holds, not new
  instrumentation.
- **A document is already a tree of focusable elements (built).** The a11y projection turns
  a rendered document into a semantic element tree (sections, divs), and the
  [find overlay](../../../crates/meerkat/src/find.rs) *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-link --> already highlights document regions
  at their rects. So "highlight the section an operator is on" reuses the rect-highlight
  path with a different target and colour.
- **Node colours + selection rings + per-pane focus (built).** The visual vocabulary
  (identity colour per node, selection ring, a focus node per pane) is there.

## The web-clip inspector is the same primitive, one scale down

Picking a document element is picking a document element, whether your cursor does it or an
operator's focus does. The web-clip inspector (planned, the
[djot editor plan](../../archive_docs/2026-08-06_completed_plans/2026-06-24_djot_editor_knot_nodes_plan.md) P4/P5: hover-pick an element
on a live scrying tile via `elementFromPoint`, capture its HTML subtree, crop its rect,
`build_clip_knot`, assert `ProvenanceSubKind::ClippedFrom`) **is the element-highlight UI**.
So three features share one element-targeting primitive:

> a focusable **target** (a graph node, or a document element) + its **rect / position** +
> a **coloured highlight**, with the **source** being your cursor, an agent's
> `focused_node`, or a guest's presence event.

Your cursor over a clip target is local self-presence at element scale. An agent reading a
section is agent-presence at element scale. They render the same way. Build the inspector
as the local-cursor source of this primitive and presence is the remote/agent source of
the same code.

## The one thing to build: the ephemeral presence channel

Presence is **live and disposable, not durable.** You do not fold "I looked at node X"
into the event-DAG the way a graph edit is folded, or the log fills with glances. So
presence rides an ephemeral channel: emit it locally (an actor message) or gossip it over
iroh, render it, let it expire, never reconcile it into the durable log. A small stream,
per operator:

```
Presence { operator_id, colour, scale: Node | Element, target_ref, trail: [recent targets] }
```

This is the standard multiplayer-presence shape, and the only new piece for *live*
presence. The durable recording modes below reuse the event-DAG + capability layer.

## Visibility is permissioned: the recording spectrum

Presence is not one mode, it is a spectrum of who-may-see-what, governed like everything
else in a moot. The same private / public / ephemeral dial from the
[wallet plan](2026-06-25_persona_wallet_carry_layer_plan.md), pointed at **conduct**
instead of content, plus one new degree of freedom (asymmetry):

- **Ephemeral** (the default): the presence channel above, gossiped and expired, never
  folded. Maximal privacy, zero record.
- **Immutable public record:** every member action as a signed event folded into the
  moot's append-only event-DAG, cleartext-gated to members. "Immutable" is free (an
  append-only signed log is tamper-evident by construction); "public" is the
  membership-gated cleartext lane.
- **Private record:** the same durable events, encrypted under the private lane, readable
  only by a capability holder.
- **One-way glass:** private record with an *asymmetric* read capability. The
  observe-activity cap is held only by mods / admins, who review what members do while
  members see neither each other nor that they are seen. The asymmetry is the new wrinkle,
  and it is exactly what a capability layer expresses (grant the cap to a role, withhold it
  from everyone else).

Three layers already carry it: the **constitution** owns the policy (the recording mode is
a constitutional parameter, amendable by the moot's rule); the **gate / capability layer**
enforces it (who holds the observe-activity cap); the **event-DAG** is the record (durable
when folded, ephemeral when not).

**A moderation and adjudication substrate.** A signed, tamper-evident, capability-gated
activity record is precisely what governance needs: moderation is the one-way glass (mods
observe), and adjudication is the immutable record resolving "who did what," plugging into
the tessera concord / reciprocity adjudication already in moothold. A dispute becomes a
query over a record that cannot be forged or quietly edited.

**The line: policy transparent even when data is restricted.** One-way glass is a power
structure, so the recording *mode* must be a published, visible constitutional parameter
("this room is recorded", "this room is moderated glass"), consented to by joining, never a
hidden capability. Covert surveillance (members unaware they are observable) is the line not
to cross, and the public, amendable constitution makes it easy to avoid. The persona dial
composes: a burner for a record-everything room, your main for a trusted one.

**Two grants, not one.** Your own conduct and your *agent's* activity are separate
visibility grants. By default a guest cannot watch your agent work (it is your instrument,
not your conduct), and a moot's recording policy carries a distinct bit for whether it
covers agent actions, defaulting to private, so a charter can *require* agent transparency
but never gets it by surprise.

## Build path

1. **Agent-local presence first (no network).** The agent harness already holds
   `focused_node`; emit an `OperatorFocus` overlay at node scale in the agent's colour,
   with a camera-follow option and a fading trail. Buildable on the overlay channel plus
   the harness today. This is "watch your AI think in the graph," shippable before
   multiplayer exists, and it is the more novel half.
2. **Into-node highlight.** Descend to the focused node's document and highlight the
   focused a11y element at its rect (reuse the find-overlay rect path). Ties to the a11y
   projection the agent already reads.
3. **The web-clip inspector** built as the local-cursor source of the same element-highlight
   primitive (djot P4/P5), so the inspector and presence share code.
4. **Co-op guests.** The same `OperatorFocus` overlay fed by a remote operator's presence
   over the ephemeral gossip channel when co-op browsing lands (the graph-mutation events
   sketched in the relational-browse / co-op lane). Fans out across windows like the sync
   chip's MW3 fan-out, so a torn-out window shows the same rings.

## Exists vs gap

**Built / named:** the cartography `Overlay` channel (node halos), `agent_harness`
`focused_node` + the a11y projection, the find overlay (document rect highlight), the
scrying / verso-scry live-tile element primitives, node colours + selection rings.

**Gap:** the ephemeral presence channel + the `OperatorFocus` overlay variant; the
into-node element-highlight wiring; the web-clip element inspector (planned, not built);
and remote presence, which waits on the co-op browsing lane.

## Open questions

- **Multiple operators on one node:** stacked / concentric rings vs a blended colour.
- **Trail length and decay**, and whether the trail is a transient comet or, per the
  agent-as-graph idea, the agent's actual operation nodes (so the same walk is *live*
  presence and a *durable* reasoning graph at once).
- **Privacy:** presence reveals what you are reading, so broadcasting your own focus to
  co-op guests is a privacy choice, not a default. It is a presence-shaped instance of the
  persona privacy dial (the [wallet plan](2026-06-25_persona_wallet_carry_layer_plan.md));
  an agent's presence is local-by-default, a guest's is opt-in per moot.
- **Element-targeting stability:** a document element reference must survive re-layout
  (anchor on the a11y / DOM node, not a pixel rect), the same anchor problem the clip
  provenance and find overlay already face.
- **The recording-mode set and per-tier defaults:** the four named modes (ephemeral /
  public-immutable / private / one-way-glass) or something more granular, and the default
  per tier (orrery = ephemeral; a large moot = the constitution's call).
- **Disclosure as a hard invariant:** whether the constitution *requires* the recording
  mode to be visible to members (the proposed line), so no moot can hide the existence of
  observation even if it restricts the data. Lean: yes, make it a constitutional invariant.
- **The observe-activity capability:** how it is delegated and revoked (meadowcap now,
  Biscuit later), and whether it is per-role (a `moderator` cap bundle) or per-grant.
- **Agent-actions-in-record:** the default (private) and whether a moot may require agent
  transparency as a charter condition of entry for agents acting in the space.
