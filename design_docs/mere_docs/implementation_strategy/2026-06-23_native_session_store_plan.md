# Mere-native session + storage store

**Date**: 2026-06-23
**Status (2026-10-06):** the HTTP and durable session layers are live in
`crates/system/fetch` (threads 1-5 and the incremental persistence: `2fa18ad`,
`6bbe6f4`, netfetcher `7c22a65`, `514334c`). Cookie custody and a flush on each
event-loop drain are in Turnstone (`turnstone/src/cookie_custody.rs`,
`turnstone/src/shell/events.rs`, turnstone `3671ad3`, 2026-09-22). The scripted-rung
`JarCookieProvider` landed in meerkat on 2026-06-23 (`435985d5`), retired with it
2026-07-18 (`c5f01064`); surviving library parts: genet's `CookieProvider` and
`StorageProvider` seams (genet `3cf326a`, `3ed0ed0`). No production `CookieProvider`
is wired in mere, genet or Turnstone, so no script writes reach the jar. Open: a
script cookie provider, durable `StorageProvider` backing, flip-back SESSION import,
the per-persona jar registry, and the `Partitioned` / top-level-site refinements.

Earlier status: Immediate HTTP/session work landed; 2026-07-04 reconciliation found
the scripted-rung cookie wiring has also landed. Remaining native-session work is
the JS-cookie persistence trigger, durable `localStorage` host backing, flip-back
SESSION import, live multi-persona jar selection, and web-privacy refinements
(`Partitioned` / top-level-site storage keys).
**Origin**: surfaced building the verso genet→scrying flip
(flipcarrier plan (`design_docs/verso_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-06-23_genet_scrying_flipcarrier_plan.md`)).
Carrying a login across a flip forced the question: *what is Mere's own session
state, where does it live, and how much of its shape is standardized?*

---

## The insight

In modeling how to carry session into the system WebView, we are really designing
Mere's native session state. The WebView is not a new model to copy. It is the
third implementation of one **standardized** model (RFC 6265bis cookies, the WHATWG
Storage Standard) that Mere already carries twice. That shared standard is exactly
what makes a flip possible: engines differ in *rendering* fidelity but agree on
*session semantics*, so cookies and storage move losslessly between them.

So the work is not "build a session store." It is: **converge on the one Mere
already uses, make it persistent + durable + partitioned, and let every consumer
(fetch, the script runtime, the flip, the WebView) read the same store.**

## Findings (verified 2026-06-23)

### Three jars, one standard library

| Where | What it is | Used by meerkat today |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **netfetcher** `cookie_jar.rs` | `InMemoryCookieJar` + the `CookieStore` trait. Full RFC 6265bis: domain/path match, `Secure`, `Max-Age` over `Expires`, `SameSite` gating, longest-path serialization. Built on the [`cookie`](https://crates.io/crates/cookie) crate. **Pluggable** (`Box<dyn CookieStore>`). | **Yes** — the http(s) WHATWG-Fetch lane (`fetch::do_fetch`). |
| **genet** `components/shared/net` (Servo net) | Full Servo jar: `cookies_for_url`/`set_cookie_for_url`, `CookieSource` (the HTTP-vs-script HttpOnly gate), `CookieStoreId` partitioning. Same `cookie` crate. | No — meerkat chose netfetcher over the heavy Servo resource thread. |
| **system WebView** (scrying) | The native OS cookie store. Black box: `set_cookie` in, `request_all_cookies` out. | Only at a flip boundary. |

All three model the cookie record with the **same `cookie` crate**, so the record
*is* the standard type, not a per-consumer invention.

### The real gap: no session persists

`fetch::do_fetch` builds a fresh `netfetcher::FetchContext::permissive()` **per
call** (`fetch.rs:257`, and again for subresources at `283`). Each fetch gets a new
`InMemoryCookieJar` that is dropped when the fetch ends. So a `Set-Cookie` from page
A is gone by the time page B is fetched: **logins do not persist across navigations
at all yet.** The flip's SESSION layer found "no host-side cookie jar" because there
is no *living* jar to read.

netfetcher already anticipates the fix. Its `FetchContext` doc says it is
"caller-owned and shareable across requests"; the seams take `&self` with interior
mutability and are `Send + Sync`, so one shared context (or one shared
`CookieStore`) is the intended shape. meerkat simply news up a throwaway each time.

### Storage (the non-cookie half)

genet's script runtime has an in-memory `localStorage` (one origin per runtime, no
persistence; `script-runtime-api/platform.rs`). `sessionStorage`, IndexedDB, and any
durability or partitioning are unbuilt. This is the genuinely-greenfield part of the
model; cookies are mostly already there.

## Standards (the "store stuff" is determined)

| Concern | Standard | State in Mere |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cookie record + domain/path/secure/expiry match | RFC 6265bis (the `cookie` crate) | netfetcher: done; genet-net: done |
| Script-vs-HTTP access (HttpOnly), SameSite gating | RFC 6265bis + `CookieSource`/`SameSiteContext` | netfetcher: stored + gated; HttpOnly access gate not yet wired to a script reader |
| `localStorage` / `sessionStorage` | WHATWG HTML §Web Storage | genet: in-memory localStorage only |
| Partitioning, quota, persistence, buckets | WHATWG Storage Standard (storage key = origin + top-level site) | genet's `CookieStoreId` is the partition key; not wired in netfetcher |
| Async cookie JS API | Cookie Store API (W3C WICG) | not yet |
| Partitioned third-party access | Storage Access API (W3C) | not yet |

The portable `verso-api::Cookie` must mirror this record (it currently omits
`SameSite`, expiry, and `Partitioned` — lossy across a flip).

## Architecture (resolved)

One **Mere session substrate**, standard-shaped, consumed by every engine:

- **Owner**: netfetcher's `CookieStore` seam (the lane meerkat fetches through).
  Keep genet's Servo-net jar as a partitioning *reference*, not a routing target
  (its weight is why meerkat chose netfetcher).
- **Persistence**: an eidetic-backed `CookieStore` (and, later, storage-area store)
  behind the existing trait. The seam is already pluggable; this is a drop-in impl.
- **Partitioning**: per the Storage Standard, key by origin + top-level site (and
  per-persona for Mere's multi-persona model). genet's `CookieStoreId` is the model.
- **Script integration**: genet's `document.cookie` / Cookie Store API and
  `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` read the **same** substrate (genet's
  `FetchHandler` is already host-injected; add a cookie/storage seam beside it), so a
  login made in JS and one made over HTTP share state.
- **Flip**: verso reads the substrate at the flip boundary to fill the SESSION layer
  (forward) and writes back on flip-back (a login made *inside* the WebView comes
  home). The WebView is synced one-shot, never continuously mirrored (charter §7).

**Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** meerkat, named as host and owner throughout this
plan, was deleted 2026-07-18 (`c5f01064`). The fetch lane and its jar are
`crates/system/fetch` (`session_jar` in `cookies.rs`, the flip in `cookies_flip.rs`,
persistence in `cookies_persist.rs`), and Turnstone holds cookie custody; its
`turnstone/src/cookie_custody.rs` cites this plan for persona keying.

## Threads

1. **Persistent shared jar** *(this session)* — meerkat holds one long-lived
   `CookieStore` injected into every `FetchContext`, so sessions persist across
   navigations. High-value on its own (logins survive browsing), independent of the
   flip. v1 is a single unpartitioned process jar.
2. **Flip SESSION layer** *(this session)* — the trigger reads `cookies_for(url)`
   from the shared jar to fill `PortableViewState.cookies`; the flip sets them on the
   WebView before navigating. A logged-in genet page flips to a logged-in WebView.
3. **Standard `verso-api::Cookie`** *(this session)* — add `same_site`, `expires`,
   `partitioned`, so the interchange is lossless.
4. **Durability + persona partitioning** *(done 2026-06-23)* — the shared jar is
   persisted to eidetic (the existing `FjallStore`, JSON blob) keyed by persona
   (`cookies/<persona>`), loaded on startup and written through on change. A login now
   survives an app restart, and one persona's session never bleeds into another (the
   hard partition; v0 is the single default persona, but the key already partitions).
   Within-persona origin matching is the jar's existing RFC 6265 logic. *Deferred:*
   live persona-switch jar-swap (not needed until v1 multi-persona), and top-level-site
   partitioning (CHIPS / the `Partitioned` flag — an orthogonal web-privacy axis).
5. **Lossless structured read** *(done 2026-06-23)* — `CookieStore::records_for`
   returns structured `CookieRecord`s (the jar now also stores `HttpOnly`), so
   `Secure` / `HttpOnly` / `SameSite` / `Domain` / `Path` / expiry cross the flip
   faithfully instead of being guessed from the URL. The trait default derives a lossy
   record from `cookies_for` for jars that don't override it. This is also the
   serialization form thread 4's durable store will persist.
6. **Script ↔ substrate + storage areas**
   - **6a. `document.cookie` ↔ the jar** — *engine seam done 2026-06-23* (genet
     `3cf326a`): a `CookieProvider` host seam (mirroring `ComputedStyleHandler` /
     `FetchHandler`) plus a `document.cookie` accessor; `get_cookies` returns the
     document's script-visible cookies, `set_cookie` records one assignment. Tested on
     boa + nova. **Meerkat wiring landed later:** the `genet.scripted` rung builds a
     `ScriptedDocument<BoaEngine>` from the already-fetched body and installs a
     `JarCookieProvider` over `fetch::session_jar()`, hiding `HttpOnly` cookies from
     script and marking the jar dirty on writes. This is not the default static HTML
     lane, but it is a live Meerkat consumer now. **Remaining:** dirty JS cookie writes
     still persist only when `persist_cookies` is called; move the dirty-gated flush to
     host event-loop drain or another regular host tick so a JS-only cookie change
     survives restart without waiting for a later page fetch. Also add a source-aware
     `set_cookie` refinement so script cannot set `HttpOnly`.
   - **6b. Durable storage areas** — *engine seam done 2026-06-23* (genet `3ed0ed0`):
     a `StorageProvider` host seam (mirroring `CookieProvider`); when set, the
     `localStorage` `__storage*` sinks route through it (the in-memory
     `HostState.storage` stays the default for tests / WPT). The host backs it durably
     and persona+origin-partitioned (e.g. eidetic write-through). Tested on boa + nova.
     **Remaining (host impl):** a `StorageProvider` over eidetic keyed by
     `(persona, origin)`, set on the scripted-rung page runtime. `sessionStorage`
     (per-session, not durable) and IndexedDB (a much larger spec) are separate.
7. **Flip-back SESSION** *(future, scoped below)* — read the WebView jar
   (`request_all_cookies`) into the substrate on flip-back.

## Scoping the remaining work

### 6a — meerkat `CookieProvider` wiring

**Update 2026-07-04:** this prerequisite is stale. Meerkat now has a scripted rung
(`genet.scripted`) that instantiates `ScriptedDocument<BoaEngine>` over the fetched
body. It is still opt-in by engine route, not the default static HTML lane, but
`document.cookie` is invoked in a live Meerkat path.

What landed:

- A `CookieProvider` over `(document_url, session_jar())`. `get_cookies` =
  `jar.records_for(url, SameSiteContext::same_site())`, **filtered to `!http_only`**
  (script must not see HttpOnly cookies), rendered `n=v; n=v`. `set_cookie` =
  `jar.set_cookie(url, header)` + arm `COOKIES_DIRTY`.
- The content actor passes it into `ScriptedDocument::<BoaEngine>::from_body(...)`;
  genet installs it before scripts run, so load-time scripts see the session jar.
- Regression coverage: `scripted_rung_document_cookie_reaches_the_jar`.

**Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** this wiring, and thread 6a's "Meerkat wiring
landed later" above, was meerkat's (`435985d5`, 2026-06-23) and left with it on
2026-07-18 (`c5f01064`). `JarCookieProvider`, the `genet.scripted` consumer and the
regression test have no hits in the tree. No production `CookieProvider` impl exists
in mere, genet or Turnstone (genet's two impls are test-only); mere only re-exports
the trait, from `ports/pelt/desktop`.

Remaining:

- **Persist trigger gap**: today the durable write fires after a *page fetch*. A
  JS-set cookie happens in the content actor off the fetch lifecycle, so move the
  (dirty-gated, cheap) `persist_cookies` call to fire on each host event-loop drain, so
  both HTTP and JS cookie changes flush on the next drain.
- **Known gap**: netfetcher's `set_cookie` is source-agnostic, so a script *could* set
  an HttpOnly cookie (the spec forbids it). The real fix is a `CookieSource` arg on
  `set_cookie` (a netfetcher refinement); low-priority.

**Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** the drain flush exists: Turnstone flushes "any
cookie a fetch or a script set since the last drain" on each event-loop drain
(`turnstone/src/shell/events.rs`, via `turnstone/src/cookie_custody.rs`; turnstone `3671ad3`,
2026-09-22). No script writer feeds it yet.

**Open, raised by the S14 pass (2026-10-06):** is the persist-trigger item done?
Options: mark it done, since Turnstone flushes on each drain; keep it open until a
script `CookieProvider` is wired and a JS-set cookie is shown to survive a restart.

### 7 — flip-back SESSION

Gated on flip-back (scry→genet) existing (flipcarrier §5, unbuilt). Once it does, the
bounded work is: `verso-scry`'s `FlipBack::extract` reads the WebView's cookies
(scrying's `request_all_cookies`) into `BackState.cookies` (already a field), and
genet's `FlipReceiver` applies them to `session_jar()` (`jar.set_cookie` per cookie)
before re-fetching. Net: a login made *inside* the compat-view WebView comes home to
genet. No new session-store surface; it rides the jar + the existing `BackState`.

### Multi-persona

v0 is the single `default_persona`; the durable layer already keys by persona
(`cookies/<persona>`), so persistence is ready. v1 multi-persona needs the **in-memory**
jar to follow the active persona:

- Replace the single process `session_jar()` with a per-persona registry
  (`HashMap<PersonaId, Arc<InMemoryCookieJar>>`), selected per request/flip.
- Thread the request's persona to the fetch worker (it currently reads one global jar):
  carry it on `FetchCommand`, or have the worker read a host-published "active persona".
- Persist/load are already per-persona; document.cookie + the flip already route through
  `session_jar`, so they select by persona for free once the registry lands.
- The hard isolation (one persona's session never touches another's) is the default,
  exactly as required; a deliberate cross-persona use (use persona B's saved login here)
  would be an explicit, authenticated bridge, never automatic — out of scope here.

## Progress

- **2026-06-23 (findings)**: mapped the three jars, the per-fetch persistence gap,
  netfetcher's shareable-context intent, and the standards table. Confirmed the
  session model is mostly *already implemented* (netfetcher, RFC 6265bis) and the
  work is persistence + convergence, not a new build.
- **2026-06-23 (threads 1-3)**: persistent shared jar (`fetch::session_jar`), flip
  SESSION layer (`fetch::session_cookies_for`), standard-shaped `verso-api::Cookie`.
  Sessions now persist across navigations; the flip carries the login. (Committed
  `2fa18ad` in mere.)
- **2026-06-23 (thread 5)**: lossless structured read. netfetcher gained
  `CookieStore::records_for` + a stored `HttpOnly` (netfetcher `7c22a65`, owned fork,
  pushed to `main`). `session_jar`
  builds `FetchContext`s through netfetcher's now-shared seam; `session_cookies_for`
  reads `records_for` and maps each `CookieRecord` to a full `verso-api::Cookie`
  (`Domain`/`Path`/`Secure`/`HttpOnly`/`SameSite`/expiry faithful; `Partitioned` still
  untracked by the jar). `cargo check -p meerkat` green; netfetcher 9 cookie tests
  green.
- **2026-06-23 (thread 4)**: durable, persona-keyed persistence. netfetcher gained
  `InMemoryCookieJar::all_records` / `load_records` (the jar snapshot + restore;
  netfetcher `514334c`, pushed; 11 cookie tests). meerkat persists the shared jar to
  its existing eidetic `FjallStore`
  as a JSON blob under `cookies/<persona>` (`fetch::persist_cookies`, dirty-gated,
  written through after each page fetch in the `FetchUpdate::Page` handler) and
  restores it on startup (`fetch::load_cookies`, right after the store opens). **A
  login now survives an app restart**; the key is persona-partitioned (v0 single
  default persona, but already partitioned). `cargo check -p meerkat` green.
- **2026-06-23 (thread 4 refinement — incremental)**: the persist is now per-cookie,
  not whole-jar. Each cookie is its own blob under `cookies/<persona>/<hex(domain,path,
  name)>`; a persisted-shadow diff writes only the cookies that changed and deletes
  blobs for cookies that are gone, so one `Set-Cookie` writes one small blob.
  `load_cookies` enumerates the persona prefix and seeds the shadow. (mere `6bbe6f4`.)
- **2026-06-23 (thread 6a engine seam)**: genet gained `document.cookie` via a
  `CookieProvider` host seam mirroring `ComputedStyleHandler` (genet `3cf326a`; native
  `__cookieGet`/`__cookieSet` sinks + a `Document.prototype.cookie` accessor; tested on
  boa + nova). **2026-07-04 note:** the original scoping sentence here said Meerkat
  had no live Genet-JS consumer yet. That was true on 2026-06-23 but is stale now;
  the scripted-rung Meerkat consumer landed later, as recorded below. Also scoped:
  flip-back SESSION (thread 7, awaits flip-back) and multi-persona (awaits v1). **The
  immediate-mere-payoff session work — threads 1-5 + the incremental refinement — is
  done: HTTP sessions persist, survive restart, and cross the flip.**
- **2026-06-23 (thread 6b engine seam)**: genet gained a `StorageProvider` host seam
  for durable `localStorage` (genet `3ed0ed0`; the `__storage*` sinks route through a
  host provider when set, in-memory default otherwise; WHATWG `Storage` shape,
  host-owned persistence + order; tested on boa + nova). Correct-ahead engine work: the
  meerkat host impl (an eidetic-backed, `(persona, origin)`-partitioned provider) shares
  6a's page-JS gating. With this, genet's cookie + localStorage stores are both
  host-backable durably; `sessionStorage` / IndexedDB / the Cookie Store API remain
  separate standards items.
- **2026-07-04 (reconciliation)**: the 6a Meerkat gating note had gone stale. The
  scripted rung now runs Genet's JS runtime (`ScriptedDocument<BoaEngine>`) for
  `genet.scripted` nodes, installs `JarCookieProvider` over the shared session jar,
  filters `HttpOnly` on reads, and marks cookies dirty on writes. Verified against
  `content/actor.rs`, `content/mod.rs`, `fetch/cookies.rs`, and the
  `scripted_rung_document_cookie_reaches_the_jar` test. Remaining is narrower than
  the old plan said: flush dirty JS cookies on host drain, add durable
  `(persona, origin)` `localStorage` backing for the scripted rung, implement
  flip-back SESSION import, and later replace the process-global jar with a live
  per-persona registry.

  **Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** the files this entry verified against were
  meerkat's and left with it on 2026-07-18 (`c5f01064`); see the correction under
  "6a — meerkat `CookieProvider` wiring" and the dated status.
- **2026-10-06 (S14 pass).** Status and claims corrected against the tree at mere
  535bca11, from the D2 record in support/doc-audit/d2/batch_40_s14_phase_b2.md: a
  dated status (fetch layers live, custody and drain flush in Turnstone, the scripted
  cookie wiring retired with meerkat, no script `CookieProvider` wired), meerkat's
  ownership noted gone, and the persist-trigger question left open for this plan's lane.
