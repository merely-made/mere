# Dramatis Tier Plan

**Date:** 2026-08-10
**Status:** ratified by Mark 2026-08-10; D1-D3 complete 2026-08-10; D4's wallet
fold-in (2026-08-10) and credential port (castellan C1-C2, 2026-08-21) done;
the `dramatis` facade reservation stays empty until something imports it
**Authority for gaz internals:** `design_docs/dramatis_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-08-08_gaz_founding_plan.md` (travels with the crate)

## What was ratified

The identity/contact tier gets a name that is not a collision with the
in-product term *persona*: `crates/persona/` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> becomes **`crates/dramatis/`**
(dramatis personae, the cast list: your faces and the other players). gaz moves
in from its standalone repo. The bare `dramatis` crates.io name is claimed as a
reservation for a possible future facade.

Considered and declined: gaz as the umbrella over the tier. gaz was defined
2026-08-08 as the contact layer specifically, sibling to gazetteer, and the
"them" side owning the "me" side inverts the model.

## Tier contents after this plan

| Crate | Package | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `crates/dramatis/personae` | `personae` | identity + carry spine (me) |
| `crates/dramatis/persona-picker` | `mere-persona-picker` | Cambium view over the roster |
| `crates/dramatis/gazette` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> | `gazette` | handle resolution (finding them) |
| `crates/dramatis/gaz` | `gaz` | stored contacts (keeping them) |

> **Moved since (2026-08-23):** `gazette` was promoted out of this tier to
> `ports/gazette`, keeping its package and lib names. The table above records
> the tier as this plan left it; the promotion and its reasoning are in the
> [suite composition census](../../2026-08-22_turnstone_suite_composition_and_capability_census.md)
> §7.3.

Package names and lib names are untouched; only the tier directory and the
workspace paths change. Consumers that take `personae` by git dep (hocket) key
on package name and are unaffected.

## Done conditions

### D1: tier rename

- [x] `crates/persona/` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> renamed `crates/dramatis/`
- [x] Root `Cargo.toml`: 3 member paths + 4 workspace.dependencies paths updated
- [x] README.md tier table row updated
- [x] Dated plan docs deliberately NOT swept (receipts, per DOC_POLICY)

### D2: gaz relocation

- [x] `repos/gaz` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> subtree-merged at `crates/dramatis/gaz` (history preserved,
      personae-consolidation precedent)
- [x] Workspace member + `gaz = { path = ... }` dependency entry added
- [x] gaz `Cargo.toml` repository field points at merely-made/mere; its bare
      `[workspace]` stub table removed so it joins mere's workspace
- [x] Disposition ruled by Mark 2026-08-10: DELETE. `repos/gaz` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> +
merely-made/gaz and `repos/dramatis` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> + merely-made/dramatis all removed
      (gaz history lives in mere via the subtree merge; the dramatis stub
      moved to crates/dramatis/dramatis and 0.0.2 published so the registry
      points at mere). Next gaz publish (0.1.0 per its founding plan) happens
      from mere; its 0.0.1 registry page carries a dead repo link until then.

### D3: the claim

- [x] `dramatis` 0.0.1 reservation published (seven-file stub anatomy per the
tulpa pattern, MIT/Apache, ed2024), local repo `repos/dramatis` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->,
      GitHub merely-made/dramatis

### D4: deferred, explicitly not this session

- [x] Wallet fold-in: `session-runtime::{wallet_store, wallet_grant}` +
      `WalletEpochSealer` into personae per the 2026-07-08 ruling. Touches the
      live seal seam; own plan when taken up.
      **Done 2026-08-10** in the [wallet carry fold-in plan](2026-08-10_wallet_carry_foldin_plan.md),
      with the scope revised by what W0 discovered: only the *model* moved, as
      `personae::carry` + `CarryRef`. The adapter (`wallet_store`, `wallet_grant`)
      and `WalletEpochSealer` deliberately stay in the store crate, since the
      sealer is the seal seam itself and the store logic is sequenced filesystem
      effects rather than a model. That crate is now
      [pandect](https://crates.io/crates/pandect). One question spun out and was
      answered 2026-08-11 in [device grants and delegation certificates](../technical_architecture/2026-08-11_device_grant_delegation_reconciliation.md).
      Mark settled the migration posture 2026-08-12 (re-issue now, no legacy
      decoder, the window being open only while every grant holder is a machine
      he can reach) and the work ran to completion the same day; its
      [migration plan](../../archive_docs/2026-08-18_completed_plans/2026-08-12_device_grant_certificate_migration_plan.md)
      was archived 2026-08-18 with nothing carried forward.
- [x] The credential-manager port (see direction below).
      **Founded 2026-08-14** as [castellan](https://crates.io/crates/castellan);
      see the [keeper founding plan](2026-08-14_castellan_keeper_founding_plan.md).
      0.0.2 published 2026-08-15, the `keeper` feature carrying the authority
      half. The credential runway is [its own plan](2026-08-10_castellan_otp_plan.md):
      C1 (the OTP core, RFC-vector-verified) and C2 (sealed items, tile and
      release gate, admitted-session consumer, Linux Secret Service, Steam
      Guard) complete 2026-08-21; product hosting open.
- [ ] Any facade content in the `dramatis` crate. The reservation stays empty
      until something imports it.

## Direction: the credential surface is a port

Ruled direction from the same conversation, recorded here so D4 has an anchor.
The password/2FA/passkey/token/wallet capability is not a new app; it is a
**port** in `mere/ports/`, sibling to graphshell and knot: a capability other
apps using mere pattern or embed. Prior ruling already places the agent's
resident home in mere/Graphshell (2026-07-22 vault/agent plan).

Shape to hold: split the port into an embeddable half (vault browse, status,
TOTP tiles; any host can compose it) and an authority half (credential release,
signing approvals) that lives with the resident and flows through the
participant gate as petitions. Hosts embed views; they never hold secrets. This
mirrors how the ssh-agent already behaves (apps talk to the pipe, never see the
key).

Standards runway for the port, in rough order of cost: TOTP/HOTP (RFC 6238/4226,
published test vectors), CXF/CXP credential import (FIDO Alliance exchange
format), OS credential surfaces (Secret Service, Keychain, Credential Manager),
KDBX import, WebAuthn/CTAP2 passkey provider (the heavyweight item). Prior art
to read for technique, not adopt wholesale: IOTA Stronghold, keyring-rs.

The port is **castellan** (ratified 2026-08-10; 0.0.1 claimed from
ports/castellan, where it will found). Tiring-house is retired: its meaning is
personae's, not the port's. The round also promoted **chatelaine** (the
secrets, exercised never shown) and **insigne** (the graded proofs, made to be
shown; what lands in someone else's gaz) to tier vocabulary; both claimed
same day (0.0.1 reservations under crates/dramatis, Mark authorized).

Both this direction and the gazette's feed direction are fleshed out in the
[credential port + gazette brief](../research/2026-08-10_credential_port_gazette_brief.md),
which owns the standards inventory and the open questions until dated plans
supersede it.

## Progress

- 2026-08-10: plan written; D1-D3 executed and verified same session. Two
  relative personae paths (servitor, commons-spine) escaped the workspace-table
  sweep and were fixed in a follow-up commit; the lesson is that consumers path
  tier crates relatively, so a tier rename greps for `persona/`, not just
`crates/persona` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->. gaz: 41 tests + doctest green from the workspace. dramatis
  0.0.1 published; merely-made/dramatis created. D4 remains deferred. Open with
  Mark: repos/gaz + merely-made/gaz disposition.
- 2026-08-10, follow-up: Mark noticed bare `gazetteer` is taken on crates.io
  while `gazette` is free, and ruled: take gazette. The crate renamed back to
  its pre-2026-07-08 name (`mere-gazetteer` -> `gazette`, dir + package + lib;
  zero consumers made it free), and `gazette` 0.0.1 published from mere. The
  2026-07-08 "an index, not a broadcast" rationale is superseded; the recovered
  sense is the official gazette, where appointments are *gazetted*: officially
  announced and thereby resolvable, which is what a resolver does.
- 2026-08-21: D4 closed. The wallet fold-in completed 2026-08-10 and
  castellan's C1-C2 completed 2026-08-21 (see the [OTP plan](2026-08-10_castellan_otp_plan.md));
  the header and the D4 checklist now say so. Only the empty `dramatis`
  facade reservation remains, still waiting for an importing consumer.
- 2026-08-27: **`emblem` renamed `insigne`**, and the name `emblem` reassigned
to the IconVG decoder (`repos/emblem`, formerly `repos/iconvg` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->). Mark's call,
  on fit asymmetry: here `emblem` worked by one metaphorical hop (an identity
  proof is *like* a heraldic badge), whereas an icon simply *is* an emblem —
  that is the older word for the thing — and Greek *emblēma* means inlaid work,
  a figure set into a larger surface, which is exactly what a decoder emitting
  path segments for a host paint-list does. The literal reading takes the word.
  **`insigne`** is the Latin singular of *insignia*, a plural whose singular
  English has dropped: one badge of office or rank, graded by construction
  (which badge you wear is chosen for the occasion), and it keeps the heraldic
  register the surrounding prose already used. Mechanically cheap: the crate
  was a pure reservation (doc comments only), with zero dependency edges in the
  workspace and zero reverse dependencies on crates.io, so the change was 57
  prose mentions across 19 files plus the two workspace lines. Plural mentions
  became *insignia* without strain. Follow-on: `chatelaine` needs a 0.0.2
  republish, since its live 0.0.1 description names `emblem` as the proofs
  half. Also decided this session: `mien` reserved for reputation (it means the
  impression others form of you, which is what reputation is), and the crates.io
  name `iconvg` deliberately left unclaimed rather than held in stewardship.
  Naming-ledger note: this is the first reclamation of a name already spent
  *and* claimed with a real publish. The rule it produces — a claimed name may
  be reclaimed when the fit is literal on one side and merely metaphorical on
  the other, and the losing side has no implementation and no dependents — has
  to be written down, or the ledger's record of what is spent stops being
  trustworthy.
