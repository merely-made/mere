# Repo Consolidation Plan

**Date:** 2026-07-23
**Status:** ruled with Mark 2026-07-23; execution started same day. Later
rulings: the bucket repo is named **smolweb**, and the errand spec crates
(spartan/nex/guppy protocols) move into it, with gemini, titan, gopher,
finger, plain, a shared TOFU/client-cert helper, and gemtext listed as
trigger-gated later extractions from errand. **Personae folds** with a
dependency-minimal wall and an explicit re-extraction trigger: the first
external verifier, interop partner, or security-audit engagement pulls it
back into a dedicated repo. Execution order is adjusted from the phase
numbering: C4 runs first among code phases (active radio hardware work wants
the merged workspace), C2 runs last (a live genet livery session holds
uncommitted edits), consumer repoints happen only after each receiving repo
is pushed green, and old repos are archived only at the very end, so no
intermediate state leaves a consumer unresolvable. This plan supersedes the
repository-boundary posture of the
[Graphshell remote projection host plan](2026-07-22_graphshell_remote_projection_host_plan.md)
sections 2, 3, and 9 where they conflict; that plan's protocol design, proof
sequence, and receipts remain in force.

**Companions:** the
[projection-engine prior-art brief](../research/2026-07-21_projection_engine_prior_art_brief.md),

[Murm peer-runtime and Moot-domain plan](2026-07-12_murm_peer_runtime_and_moot_domain_plan.md)
(promotion rows withdrawn by this plan), and the
[mere/turnstone boundary pass plan](2026-07-09_mere_turnstone_boundary_pass_plan.md) *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-link -->.

## 1. Ruling

Mere is the platform; the family repos that were extracted from it remain its
components wherever they are packaged. The 2026-07-22 Graphshell plan framed
the session stack as a product-neutral commons with Mere as one endpoint among
peers. That framing is withdrawn. Graphshell is Mere's shell and remote port,
the session protocol is Mere's session grammar, and an application that
implements the endpoint is participating in Mere. The genet/pelt shape is the
governing precedent: the platform repo hosts its own contracts, runtime, and
reference shell, and products consume them from it.

The bar for a separate repository: **real coherent utility and identity apart
from mere, genet, turnstone, woodshed, hocket, and isometry.** A repo below that
bar folds into mere or genet, or is consumed through them. The dependency
graph should mostly pull mere or genet.

One structural invariant makes the split between the two buckets: nothing
genet consumes may move into mere, or genet acquires a cycle. Genet's family
pulls are netrender, netfetcher, misfin, and wgpu-scry; all stay genet-side or
independent.

## 2. Target shape

```text
products     turnstone   isometry   woodshed   hocket
                \         |          |        /   (hocket also -> wavicle, woodshed)
platform     mere ................................ genet
             graph domain, murm/moot,             engine, pelt, cambium,
             graphshell, eidetic, scenograph,     sprigging, meristem,
             conatus, personae, servitor,         netfetcher, tinct
             armillary, vates, sibylla
                \                                  /
components   netrender   wavicle   radio   wgpu interop   smolweb (misfin)
```

Products pull mere and genet; the two platforms pull the components that pass
the bar. Crates.io package names survive every move; only repository homes,
`repository` fields, and git URLs change.

## 3. What moves

### Into mere (one folder per incoming family under `crates/`)

| Incoming repo | Crates | Consumers to repoint |
|---|---|---|
| personae | `personae` | woodshed, hocket, isometry, mere's `identity` alias |
| armillary | `armillary` | mere, turnstone, isometry, hocket, vates |
| eidetic | `muniment`, `codicil`, `chartulary`, `scholia` | mere (graph-kernel, session-runtime, murm, moot, mesh, intel, eidetic lane), turnstone, isometry, woodshed, hocket, servitor |
| servitor | `servitor` | mere, turnstone |
| vates | `vates` | mere |
| sibylla | `sibylla` | mere |
| conatus | `numen`, `quint`, `seiche` | mere (currently crates.io pins; become workspace paths) |
| scenograph | `sceno`, `scenomise`, `scenotime`, `scenograph` | mere, turnstone, isometry, graphshell |
| graphshell | `chirograph`, `graphshell-client`, `graphshell-endpoint`, `graphshell-stdio`, `graphshell` | turnstone, isometry |

Notes:

- The incoming eidetic four join `crates/eidetic/` beside the existing
  adapter lane (`eidetic-core`, `eidetic-fjall`, fetchers, search). This
  settles the mere-eidetic naming: primitives and adapters live in one folder,
  and the orphaned bare `eidetic` crates.io name is documented where it is
  reserved.
- `crates/persona/identity` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> (the dead duplicate) is deleted in the same change
  that lands personae; the workspace `identity` alias becomes a workspace path.
- The graphshell five keep their crate names and land under
  `crates/graphshell/`; the facade is Mere's reference client, pelt-shaped.
- Scenograph is below the bar today because every consumer is mere-side. If
  outside consumers materialize later, extraction is available then; the P3/P4
  receipts attach to crate contents and survive the move.

### Into genet

| Incoming repo | Crates | Consumers to repoint |
|---|---|---|
| cambium | `cambium`, `cambium-nematic`, `cambium-winit`, `meristem`, `sprigging` | turnstone; genet's `genet_web_smoke` example path dep becomes a workspace reference |
| netfetcher | `netfetcher` | genet (genet-documents, genet-wpt become workspace refs), mere (`crates/system/fetch`) |

tinct already lives in genet (`components/tinct` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->); woodshed and hocket repoint
from the `mark-ik/tinct` mirror to genet.git and the mirror repo retires with
a tombstone.

### New smolweb bucket

New repo `smolweb`. `misfin` moves in (MIT, held in stewardship; the transfer
offer to the protocol author stays visible in the repo README). Candidates to
join: `spartan-protocol`, `nex-protocol`, `guppy-protocol`, currently inside
genet's errand component; **decision gate: Mark rules whether they move now or
stay in genet.** Errand itself stays in genet as the client integration and
keeps consuming `misfin` from crates.io, unchanged.

### Radio family

Execute the already-ruled merge: `tulle`, `sennet`, `tucket` fold into the
`retinue` workspace, preserving crate names, histories, provenance files, and
the license split (crates MIT/Apache, firmware images GPLv3, kept in separate
folders exactly as today). Mere's `path = "../retinue"` becomes a git pin to
the merged workspace.

### Stays separate, passing the bar

| Repo | Why it passes |
|---|---|
| netrender | Public render engine, servo-upstream lineage, upstream of both platforms. Fold target if ever ruled otherwise is genet, never mere. |
| wavicle | First pure-Rust WavPack codec; zero family coupling. |
| radio workspace | Own hardware, firmware, FCC, and business surface. |
| wgpu-graft, wgpu-scry, wgpu-weld | Standalone public interop libs, one-way deps, consumed via pins. Optional later: one wgpu workspace. |
| smolweb | Public protocol family with stewardship obligations. |
| merely-made.github | Brand site; no Rust edges. |

### Withdrawn

The murm/moot promotion to `repos/murm` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> and `repos/moot` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> is withdrawn. They
stay in mere; isometry keeps pulling them from mere.git. The audio-primitives
standalone promotion is deferred: hocket repoints to woodshed.git, and a
standalone repo waits for a third consumer.

## 4. Invariants and walls

1. **No cycle:** netrender, netfetcher, misfin, wgpu-* never enter mere.
2. **The walls travel.** The Graphshell session crates keep their G0-G4
   discipline inside Mere, while the reference application lives at
   `ports/graphshell`: checks are scoped to those crates plus the Scenograph four:
   no kernel or product dependency from the portable crates, wasm32 check for
   `chirograph`/`-client`, warning-denying clippy. Genet's
   `genet-host-api` is the precedent that contracts stay honest inside a
   platform repo only when the checks are mechanical.
3. **History preserved.** Every absorption is a subtree/merge that keeps the
   incoming repo's history, the technique already used for the eidetic and
   conatus family merges and graphshell PR #308. Absorbed GitHub repos are
   archived with a tombstone README naming the new home. crates.io publishes
   continue from the new home; `repository` fields update at next publish.
4. **Licenses unchanged per crate.** Incoming mere-side crates are MIT/Apache
   already; MPL stays genet-side (Servo-derived only), per the founding
   convention. **Superseded 2026-08-22** by the
   [license posture brief](../../2026-08-22_license_posture_brief.md): platform
   code, mere and genet included, is MPL-2.0; consumers license themselves.
5. **One absorption per change.** Each move lands as one commit pair: subtree
   plus workspace membership in the receiving repo, consumer repoints in the
   same session. Targeted `cargo check -p` per touched consumer, not broad
   workspace checks, while sibling work is in flight. No concurrent test runs.

## 5. Phases

### C0. Record the ruling in the docs

- Amend the Graphshell plan: status note pointing here; section 2's
  "must not depend on Mere" becomes a crate-linkage rule (portable crates do
  not link the kernel) rather than a repo rule; section 3's repo layout
  superseded; section 9 rows updated (murm/moot withdrawn, audio-primitives
  deferred, boundary map reread against the bar).
- Amend the prior-art brief with one dated note: the projection
  compiler/runtime destination is realized as the scenograph family inside
  mere; Mere names the platform, not one product among peers.
- Amend DOC_POLICY's inheritance paragraph: new Graphshell documentation
  belongs in mere's design_docs again once the crates land.
- DOC_README updated in the same session as each amendment.

**Done when:** no active doc contradicts the target shape in section 2.

### C1. Pin hygiene with non-moving targets

- woodshed and hocket: tinct repointed to genet.git.
- hocket: audio-primitives to woodshed.git, wavicle to wavicle.git or
  crates.io.

**Done when:** woodshed and hocket build from clean clones with those pins,
and no committed sibling path targets a repo that is staying put.

### C2. Genet absorption

- Subtree cambium (five crates) and netfetcher into genet; workspace
  membership; `genet_web_smoke`'s cambium path dep becomes a workspace
  reference, removing the example-only cycle.
- Repoint turnstone (cambium, sprigging) and mere (`crates/system/fetch`,
  netfetcher) to genet.git.
- Archive the cambium and netfetcher GitHub repos with tombstones.

**Done when:** a fresh genet clone builds the absorbed crates, turnstone and
mere check green on the new pins, and the old repos are read-only.

### C3. Mere absorption, bottom-up

Ordered so mere is green after every sub-step. Coordinate with in-flight
sibling sessions before C3b; the eidetic step touches every product.

- **C3a personae + armillary.** Delete `crates/persona/identity` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->; the
  `identity` alias becomes a workspace path. Repoint woodshed, hocket,
  isometry.
- **C3b eidetic four** into `crates/eidetic/`. Repoint turnstone, isometry,
  woodshed, hocket, servitor (interim, until C3c), and mere's own git pins
  become paths.
- **C3c servitor, vates, sibylla, conatus.** All their family deps are now
  workspace-internal. Mere's crates.io pins for numen/quint/seiche become
  workspace paths.
- **C3d scenograph four** into `crates/scenograph/`. Repoint turnstone and
  isometry.
- **C3e graphshell five** into `crates/graphshell/`, with the section 4 CI
  walls landing in the same change. Repoint turnstone and isometry. Re-archive
  mark-ik/graphshell with a tombstone; its donor lineage and the 2026-07-22
  portable workspace remain in its read-only history, and the same history
  arrives in mere via the subtree.

**Done when:** all nine incoming families build as mere workspace members
from a fresh clone, every consumer is repointed and green, the G1-G4
receipt tests pass from their new home, and the absorbed repos are
archived.

### C4. Radio merge

Per the standing ruling: tulle, sennet, tucket into the retinue workspace;
provenance and license split preserved; mere's transport pin becomes git.

**Done when:** one radio workspace builds all crates and firmware targets,
and mere clean-clones without the path dep.

### C5. Smolweb bucket

Found `repos/smolweb`; subtree misfin in; stewardship note in the README;
resolve the errand-protocols decision gate with Mark before or during this
phase.

**Done when:** misfin builds and publishes from smolweb, genet errand is
unchanged, and the old misfin repo is tombstoned.

### C6. Verify and disseminate

- Tree-wide gate: no committed cross-repo `path =` dependency remains.
- Clean-clone builds: mere, genet, turnstone, woodshed, hocket, isometry.
- Regenerate the repo dependency graph and compare against section 2.
- Update the memory index and any plan that names an old home.
- Archive this plan per DOC_POLICY on completion.

**Done when:** the regenerated graph matches the target shape and the six
primary repos build from clean clones.

## Findings

- Manifest sweep of all 28 repos, 2026-07-23: mere is the apex consumer with
  13 family deps and in-degree 2 (turnstone deep, isometry murm/moot lane);
  every product consumes genet, netrender, and eidetic; mere and graphshell
  have identical dependents (turnstone, isometry).
- Committed sibling paths found in hocket (woodshed, eidetic, armillary,
  personae, wavicle), woodshed (chartulary, scholia, personae), and mere
  (retinue, personae via `identity`), beyond the known radio-family paths.
  All are eliminated by C1 through C4.
- conatus reaches mere as crates.io pins today (`numen 0.1`, `quint 0.0.2`,
  `seiche 0.0.3`); it has no consumer outside mere.
- The `mark-ik/tinct` mirror duplicates `genet/components/tinct` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->.
- `crates/persona/identity` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> is a dead duplicate; the live alias already
  targets personae by path.
- genet's `genet_web_smoke` example reaches cambium by sibling path,
  a dev-only cycle that C2 removes.
- The 2026-07-22 Graphshell plan's product-dependency walls are receipts
  about crate contents, not repo homes; they relocate intact as CI checks.

## Progress

### 2026-07-23

- Ruled with Mark: the separate-repo bar, the mere and genet buckets, the
  smolweb bucket for misfin, tinct through genet, and the withdrawal of the
  neutral-commons framing. Plan written.
- **C0 landed** (mere `73d8b1b1`): supersession notes on the Graphshell plan,
  the prior-art brief, and DOC_POLICY, plus the DOC_README entry.
- **C4 landed** (retinue `e071d08`). tulle, sennet, and tucket are subtree
  members of the retinue workspace with history preserved:
  `crates/{retinue,tulle,phy-profile,sennet,tucket}`, `firmware/` as
  non-default members, `vendor/lora-phy` keeping its own MIT/Apache licensing.
  Sibling `../tulle` path deps resolve unchanged under `crates/`. Gates:
  fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, 251 tests, retinue and sennet/tucket sans-io
  builds, and `tulle-t114-phy` for `thumbv7em-none-eabihf`. mere repointed to
  a branch pin (`9430c441`), `mere-transport --features reticulum` green.
  Findings worth keeping:
  - The family was **relicensed MIT/Apache to MPL-2.0** the same day, with a
    MeshCore NOTICE in tucket and `vendor/lora-phy` untouched. This
    supersedes section 4's "licenses unchanged per crate" for the radio
    bucket; `deny.toml` already allows MPL-2.0. The founding MIT/Apache
    convention now has a deliberate exception, recorded here rather than
    treated as drift.
  - Deleting the incoming sub-lockfiles lost pins the firmware needed:
    `fixed` re-resolved to 1.31.0, which requires rustc 1.93 against a 1.92
    toolchain. Recovered by pinning 1.30.0 from tulle's old lock. **Every
    later absorption must diff the incoming lockfile before discarding it.**
  - tulle, sennet, and tucket had no CI; joining retinue's gated workspace
    surfaced eight pre-existing lints, now fixed or allowed with reasons.
    Absorbing an ungated repo into a gated one is a code-change event, not a
    move. Expect the same in C2 and C3.
  - Windows held a lock on the freshly written firmware images, so
    `git mv` of the directory failed; moving each subdirectory worked.
- **C1 landed** (woodshed `aa8026d` on the `redesign` branch, hocket
  `7fe70e1`): tinct now comes from genet.git in both, and hocket's
  audio-primitives and wavicle sibling paths became git pins.
  `cargo check -p hocket-engine` green. woodshed's active branch is
  `redesign`, not `main` — hocket's woodshed pin tracks `main` deliberately.
- **C2 landed** (genet `ccb0b5d91df`, pushed). cambium and netfetcher are
  genet components:
  `components/cambium/{cambium,cambium-nematic,cambium-winit,meristem,sprigging}`
  and `components/netfetcher`, histories preserved. Checks green for all six
  plus `genet-documents --features netfetch`; the standalone
  `genet_web_smoke` example resolves. Consumers repointed: turnstone's cambium
  and sprigging, mere's netfetcher, both to genet.git. Findings:
  - **The absorption paid for itself immediately.** cambium carried three
    `[patch.crates-io]` entries (stylo_taffy, gpu-allocator, taffy) that
    existed *only* because path patches do not transit to git consumers.
    Path deps inside one workspace made all three unnecessary. The
    `genet_web_smoke` sibling path also became in-repo, closing the dev-only
    cycle between the two repos.
  - **Workspace inheritance is the real hazard in an absorption, not paths.**
    genet's `[workspace.package]` is Servo-shaped (version 0.2.0,
    `repository = servo/servo`, `publish = false`); cambium's crates are
    independently published at 0.1.0-0.3.0 under three different licenses.
    Inheriting silently would have mislabelled and unpublishable them. They
    now spell out version, rust-version, and repository, which is what
    genet's other adopted components (tinct, errand) already do. **C3 must
    check the same for every incoming crate against mere's workspace.**
  - Another session was live in genet throughout; its livery work was
    committed forward in two batches (`9d366ffefd5`, plus a length-value
    pass) before each subtree add, since `git subtree` refuses a dirty tree.
    One `cargo check` failure on untouched code proved transient on retry,
    as the workflow memory predicts.
- **C5 landed** (smolweb founded and pushed; genet `2a7c34c7b98`). The
  workspace holds misfin (history preserved via subtree) plus
  spartan-protocol, nex-protocol, and guppy-protocol; 47 tests pass. genet
  keeps errand and nematic and pins the wire layer from crates.io at `=0.1.1`,
  matching how it already consumed misfin. Finding: the three crates were
  copied rather than subtree-split — `git subtree split` over genet's history
  did not finish in ten minutes, so their 2026-07-10 to 2026-07-23 history
  stays in genet under `components/errand/protocols/` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->, recorded in the
  smolweb README. **A split out of a large repo is not a viable history move;
  plan for copy-plus-pointer.**
- **C3 landed** (mere `6a37de6b`, pushed). All nine families are mere
  workspace members with history preserved; the dead
  `crates/persona/identity` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> duplicate is deleted. `cargo check --workspace`
  is green except `document-host`, which is red on servitor's in-flight
  capability model from another session's unpushed commit — a break that
  predates the move, since mere already built against the local servitor
  through its patch file. Products repointed to mere.git: hocket, woodshed,
  and isometry committed and green (`isometry-genet`, which consumes
  scenograph and graphshell, builds clean); turnstone verified last. Findings:
  - **The gitignored `.cargo/config.toml` patch files are the sharp edge of
    an absorption, and they are invisible to `git status`.** In mere, a
    redirect pointing at a path that is now a workspace member is a hard
    lockfile collision (`package collision in the lockfile`), not a warning,
    so every absorbed entry had to be deleted. In the four products the same
    entries had to be *redirected* to the new in-mere paths instead. Five
    files, none of them tracked in mere's case. Any future move must treat
    them as part of the change.
  - **Absorbing half a version-unified family splits it.** `graph-kernel`
    pulled numen from crates.io while quint used the workspace copy, so two
    numen versions landed in one graph and `mere-canvas` failed with
    "expected `quint::FieldId`, found `kernel::graph::FieldId`". The old
    crates.io patch had been hiding this. graph-kernel and moothold now take
    the workspace deps.
  - mere's `[workspace.package]` needed an `authors` key so the scenograph
    crates could keep inheriting; unlike genet's Servo-shaped defaults, the
    rest of mere's values already matched what the incoming families
    declared.
  - woodshed tracks its `.cargo/config.toml` (unlike mere and the others),
    so its machine-local absolute paths are committed. Pre-existing, noted
    rather than changed.
- **Toolchain bumped** (retinue `ac2fe43`). The machine's default rustup
  toolchain was **1.92.0**, five releases behind current stable; it is now
  **stable 1.97.1**. This closes the C4 firmware failure properly, and the
  post-mortem corrects what that entry said:
  - retinue **gitignores `Cargo.lock` while tulle tracked its own**, so the
    merge silently dropped the firmware's pinned resolution. The `fixed`
    1.30.0 downgrade recorded in C4 was therefore never committed — it was a
    local lockfile edit only, and a fresh clone would still have failed. The
    real fault was two-sided: an ancient default toolchain and a lost
    lockfile. Both are now closed (default bumped; `Cargo.lock` tracked, with
    the reason written into `.gitignore`).
  - **An absorption inherits the receiving repo's ignore rules, and that can
    silently drop the incoming repo's guarantees.** Diff `.gitignore` as well
    as manifests. Generalizes the C4 lockfile finding.
  - The six primary repos plus cambium pin 1.96.0 (wgpu-graft 1.95.0) via
    `rust-toolchain.toml` and are unaffected by the default. retinue and
    smolweb deliberately carry no pin and follow the default; both are green
    on 1.97.1 (retinue: fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, 251 tests, thumbv7em
    firmware; smolweb: 47 tests). The family pins are now one release behind
    stable — bumping them is a separate, deliberate pass.
- **C6 done.** Five absorbed repos still had unpushed work (conatus, eidetic,
  personae, scenograph, servitor — the last being the capability-model commit
  that breaks `document-host`); all pushed before anything was archived, so
  nothing existed only locally. personae's local `main` tracked `origin/master`
  and needed `push origin main:master`. READMEs updated: mere's workspace-layout
  table gained the nine families and its sibling section was rewritten around
  the bar; genet's records cambium/netfetcher in and the protocol crates out;
  eleven absorbed crate READMEs had links to repositories that no longer hold
  them. The `pack-distribution` probe still pointed at `../../../../personae`,
  which deletion would have broken — now `../../persona/personae`. Fifteen
  GitHub repos carry a tombstone README plus a "moved into X" description and
  are **archived**; fourteen local checkouts deleted (graphshell's kept, per
  Mark's history exception). Builds verified green afterward.
  - **Archive, do not delete.** crates.io shows each published version's
    `repository` URL forever; deleting the repo turns every one of those links
    into a permanent 404, and archiving already removes them from the active
    repo list. The family's own precedent agreed before this pass: muniment,
    codicil, and chartulary were archived, not deleted, at the eidetic merge.

### 2026-07-24

- The platform/reference-product distinction is now physical. Graphshell's
  reusable protocol, client, endpoint, and carrier remain under
  `crates/graphshell`; the `graphshell` reference application and its receipts
  live under `ports/graphshell`. `scripts/check_port_boundaries.py` rejects any
  crate-to-port dependency.
- The governing Genet precedent was corrected at the same time. Pelt and its
  private desktop support live under `ports/pelt`; the former `pelt-core`
  contracts are the product-neutral `components/genet-host-api`. Mere and
  Turnstone consume that component and have no dependency on Pelt. Genet's
  dependency-cone CI rejects component-to-port edges.

- **Archived repos will be DELETED, not kept — Mark, 2026-07-24.** This
  reverses the C6 "archive, do not delete" finding above. Every archived repo
  is deleted **except `graphshell`**, whose donor docs live nowhere else (mere
  holds only the harvest indexes). The 404 objection is answered by doing the
  publish sweep *first*, so each crate's Repository link points at its new home
  before its old repo disappears; Mark chose the **full sweep** over accepting
  old-version 404s. Verified before acting: every absorbed repo's docs survive
  in its destination (the eidetic four, scenograph, vates, sibylla, personae,
  cambium, and tucket all confirmed — tucket's `design_docs` were lifted to
  retinue's top-level `design_docs/` by the C4 merge, not kept under
  `crates/tucket/` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->).
  - **Split by blast radius.** Five archived repos need no repoint at all and
    are safe to delete immediately: `eidetic` and `servitor` (their crates
    carry no `repository`), and `tulle`/`sennet`/`tucket` (their crates already
    point at `retinue`, which stays). `misfin` repoints from the clean smolweb
    workspace. The remaining nine (chartulary, codicil, muniment, scenograph,
    sibylla, vates, cambium, netfetcher, personae) back **17 published crates**
    and need the sweep first.
  - **Blocked 2026-07-24 on two independent things**, neither worked around:
    (1) `gh repo delete` is refused by the Claude Code auto-mode classifier, so
    the deletions need an explicit Bash permission rule or Mark's own hand —
    deleting via the raw API instead would defeat the guardrail; (2) mere and
    genet were both live under another session (genet 23 dirty files), and
    publishing 17 crates from a dirty tree can ship a half-state permanently.

## Open

**Closed since:** the publish sweep ran (21 crates republished at their new
homes) and every absorbed repository is deleted except `graphshell`, which
stays archived because its donor design docs live nowhere else — mere holds
only the harvest indexes.

### Dangling-reference audit, 2026-07-24

Deleting the repos turned every surviving reference to them into a hard
break, and three had been missed. **`git ls-remote` against each retired
URL is the check; a build passing locally proves nothing**, because a cached
`~/.cargo/git` checkout plus a pinned lockfile hides a deleted remote until
someone clones fresh.

- **mere git-dep'd the deleted `mark-ik/misfin`** (`Cargo.toml`, the
  workspace `misfin` entry). A clean clone could not have fetched it. Now a
  crates.io pin at `0.0.4`, which is how genet's errand already consumed it
  (mere `0086c9c3`).
- **errand pinned misfin `0.0.3` while mere pinned `0.0.4`.** `0.0.x`
  versions never unify, so mere's graph carried two copies. errand moved to
  `0.0.4`; `0.0.4` is `0.0.3` plus a repository field, so nothing else moved
  (genet `890c4e86612`).
- **Three fulfilled name-claim placeholders** (`support/name-claims/`
  cambium, meristem, sprigging) still declared `repository = mark-ik/cambium`.
  Repointed at genet, where those crates now live.

Accepted, not fixable: **`cambium-winit 0.2.0` is yanked with its
`repository` pointing at the deleted cambium repo.** The consolidation
rewired it onto `genet-layout` + `genet-winit-host`, which inherit genet's
`publish = false`, so no corrected version can ever be published. The
archived `graphshell` repo's frozen manifest likewise still names
`scenograph.git`; it is read-only and never built.

**Consequence caught 2026-07-24: `cambium-winit` being unpublishable is a
consumer problem, not just a registry one.** woodshed's committed manifest
pinned `cambium-winit = "0.3.0"` from crates.io — a version that does not
exist and never can. It built only because the gitignored patch file supplied
it. All three (`cambium`, `cambium-winit`, `sprigging`) now come from
genet.git, matching what hocket landed the same day after a clean Linux
checkout caught a second reason: the published cambium/sprigging depend on the
crates.io `paint_list_api` while these workspaces git-dep netrender's, so a
`sprigging::PaintCmd` is not a `paint_list_api::PaintCmd`, and
`[patch.crates-io]` cannot redirect a published crate's own registry
dependency. **A crate that inherits `publish = false` through a path dep must
be consumed by git, never by version** (woodshed `abdf524`).

## Still open

- ~~Bumping the toolchain pins~~ **partly done 2026-07-24.** Bumped and
  verified: **mere**, **genet**, **woodshed** (1.96.0) and **wgpu-graft**
  (1.95.0), all to **1.97.1**. Still on 1.96.0: **isometry**, **hocket**,
  **turnstone** — each fails to compile *before* the bump, so there was nothing
  to verify against; see below. Findings:
  - **The expected lint problem never materialised.** Only wgpu-graft gates on
    warnings among the pinned repos (`RUSTFLAGS: -D warnings`), and its
    published crate `grafting` is clean on both toolchains. mere, turnstone,
    hocket, and isometry have **no CI at all**; genet and woodshed gate on
    check/test only. So the real bar was "does it still compile", not "are
    there new lints".
  - **rustup targets are per-toolchain.** genet's `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
    gate went from clean to failing purely because that target was not
    installed for 1.97.1. `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` fixed it.
    Worth knowing before reading a cross-compile failure as a code regression.
  - Pre-existing breakage found while verifying, none of it caused by the
    bump and none of it mine to fix: **isometry** has a truncated
    `isometry-net/src/session.rs` committed (ends on a dangling `#[derive]`);
    **hocket** misses `Config.require_signed_manifest`, the in-flight luggage
    auto-update work; **turnstone** has an unclosed delimiter. genet's CI
    `--all-targets` step has 9 errors on both toolchains, all from
    `tests/unit/style`, which is pinned to an older Stylo surface and uses
    `#![feature]` on stable. wgpu-graft's CI names a package
    (`wgpu-native-texture-interop`) that does not exist in the workspace.

### MSRV, ruled and defended 2026-07-24

**1.88, on the nine community-facing crates only** — smolweb's four
(`bcc70c7`) and retinue's five (`97eef7d`). Not a family-wide number: mere's
graph floors at 1.96 (p2panda-auth) and a single `max()` would pessimise every
leaf crate.

The number is measured, not chosen. 1.85, the edition-2024 floor, was tried
first and fails: `time` (through misfin's TLS lane) declares 1.88 itself, and
the protocol crates plus retinue/sennet/tucket use let-chains, stabilized in
1.88.

**Cargo records `rust-version` but never checks the code builds on it**, so an
undefended MSRV drifts silently and downstream meets a compile error instead of
a clean "requires a newer rustc". Both repos now run an `msrv` CI job on
exactly 1.88. retinue's job names its five host crates rather than running at
the workspace root: the firmware is a workspace member that reaches rustc 1.93
through `fixed`, and it is unpublished, so it deliberately does not inherit the
floor.

Everything else stays silent on purpose. Apps (turnstone, hocket, woodshed's
binary, isometry, pelt) have no downstream consumers, so the toolchain pin is
the real control; isometry's stale `rust-version = "1.80"` survives only
because it is still edition 2021. The ~21 published mere/genet crates have no
external consumers yet either, so an MSRV there would be maintenance for an
audience that does not exist.

Smolweb had no CI at all and had never been formatted or lint-gated — it
carried genet's house style without genet's rustfmt config. It now has the
full gate set, and the MSRV work cleared ten clippy lints along the way.
- ~~`document-host` versus servitor's capability model~~ **closed 2026-07-24**
  (mere `4b8d875f`). The `doc/` import bridge now derives its grant through
  `Cap::scope`, denying on a parse failure so the lane stays fail-closed, and
  its test moved from the removed `PrefixAuthority` to `GrantTable` with a
  typed scope. 22 document-host tests pass including the gate itself, and
  `cargo check --workspace` on mere is green for the first time since the
  capability round landed.
- The four `graphshell-*` crates remain unpublished (the facade name is held
  by the retired donor). They will churn through G5-G7, so there is no reason
  to claim the names before the protocol settles.
