# Graph Behaviors Plan: watches, cascades, and the reactive participant

**Date:** 2026-08-13
**Redesign status, 2026-09-20:** the Servitor resident/run design in
[section 8](#8-servitor-resident-and-run-redesign-2026-09-20) extends the landed
behavior primitives. R1a admission, the R1b reducer and the Turnstone adapter
have source implementations with static review. Cargo validation and the
portable consumer pin remain pending. R2 and R3 remain planned. The earlier receipts cover only their original implementations.
**Status:** W0 through W5 landed 2026-08-13, with a green headed receipt
(`turnstone scenarios/behaviors_wake.scn`, captures under
`Code/testing/turnstone/behaviors_wake`). Two follow-ups remain: the review row
clips in the palette, and the clock, app-tier and budget slices have no headed
receipt of their own. The cascade-frequency gap named 2026-08-16 closed at the
actuation boundary on 2026-08-18. Originally open. Designed with Mark 2026-08-13 (the "neat lil ideas"
conversation: one node triggering others nearby to refresh, summaries from
connected nodes captured into a knot note, and the family of automations
behind them).

---

## 1. The ruling this plan rests on

**Two tiers, split by one test: does it write graph truth?**

- **Projection rules** read truth and change only how things look or arrange:
  nearby-refresh, staleness badges, rollup displays, edge visibility. They are
  recomputed, not committed, so they need no gate, no attribution, and no
  cascade discipline. The scriptable field regions plan already owns this
  tier (a placed spatial region carrying rhai rules); "refresh what is near
  this node" is one more rule kind there. This plan does not build any of it.
- **Graph behaviors** write truth. A behavior is a **participant with a trigger**:
  the identity, grant, petition, and attributed-journal machinery from the
  participant gate plan, plus one new thing: a standing subscription that
  runs the body when something it watches changes, instead of waiting to be
  invoked. The gate answers "may it write"; this plan answers "when does it
  run".

Everything the gate plan ruled carries over unchanged: one authority model,
petitions through `servitor::Gate`, no raw positions (spatial influence goes
through fields, never petitions), auditability plus compensating actions
rather than universal undo.

**The scripting question is not open.** The lanes exist and are placed:
rhai for privileged local automation (the omnibar `>`-shell, knot
note-block eval), **piccolo Lua for sandboxed participant bodies** (turnstone
`src/denizen.rs`: `.lua` control scripts under a step budget, bindings
derived from the participant's authority in `src/component.rs`), Wasm components
for portable untrusted mods (the ring-gated `app-core` world, B3). A
behavior body is whatever the participant already runs; this plan adds no
language. Note the 2026-06 four-lane map predates the piccolo lane; the
memory-level map should read five.

## 2. Findings (code-verified substrate)

Every site below was read this session, not recalled.

- **The delta spine exists and is attributed.**
  [`graph-kernel/src/graph/journal.rs`](../../../crates/graph/graph-kernel/src/graph/journal.rs):
  `GraphJournal` is a `codicil::Codicil<AttributedDelta>` where
  `AttributedDelta { author, delta: CapturedDelta }`; `author` is `user`,
  a participant subject's hex, or `pre-gate`. It carries `Seq`, `live_cursor()`,
  `replay_from(since, graph)`, and `record_as(author, delta)`. A trigger
  consumer is a cursor-holding reader of this tail. Wasm-clean by its own
  module doc.
- **The commit receipt and the consumer discipline exist.**
  [`chartulary/src/commit.rs`](../../../crates/eidetic/chartulary/src/commit.rs):
  `commit_batch(author, expected, specs) -> Committed { batch: BatchId, .. }`,
  and the test `effects_enqueue_only_after_a_commit_lands` demonstrates the
  post-commit effect pattern (effects carry the batch id, enqueue only after
  a landed commit). The nested-graph (participant world) side of triggering
  follows that discipline as designed.
- **The gate is built.**
  [`servitor/src/gate.rs`](../../../crates/servitor/src/gate.rs):
  `Gate::petition(provider, nested, subject, claimed, expected, specs)` runs
  projection-guard, authority (`AuthorityProvider::covers(subject, cap,
  Mode::Write)`), per-node scope containment, then an attributed
  revision-checked commit. `Cap::{Power, Scope}` with segment-prefix scope
  coverage is in `cap.rs`; delegation rides personae signed certs.
- **The runnable body and its budget exist.** turnstone
  `src/denizen.rs`: the node IS the participant (binding facet + nested world),
  `RunDenizen { member }` runs a piccolo control script under a step budget,
  and `src/ring.rs` checks every emitted Action's ring at emission.
  `src/component.rs` derives `ScriptCapabilities` from the participant's
  authority. Subjects are content-derived (`blake3(source)`), so an edited
  body is a new subject facing fresh review.
- **The app-tier event stream exists and names this consumer.** turnstone
  [`src/observe.rs`](../../../../turnstone/src/observe.rs): `AppEvent` +
  `Snapshot`, drained each frame, with the module doc stating that later
  automation consumers "subscribe at the same drain".
- **What does not exist:** any way for a participant to run other than explicit
  invocation. No watch registration, no delta matching, no cascade
  discipline, no time source for behaviors. That is the whole gap, and it is
  narrow.

## 3. Design

### 3.1 A watch is a scope, and the scopes nest

A behavior declares a **watch**: the region of the graph whose changes wake
it. The watch is a `Cap::Scope`, the same vocabulary as its grant, with one
containment law enforced at registration:

```text
watch scope ⊆ read scope ⊆ grant
```

You cannot be woken by what you cannot read. This is where the wavelet
brief's Trigger/Observe split actually lands, not as edge kinds on the data
graph but as the two capability scopes of a behavior: watch = trigger, read
beyond watch = observe. The data graphs stay declarative; agency lives
entirely in the participant tier.

(Vocabulary: **watch** ruled by Mark 2026-08-13, recorded in
[TERMINOLOGY.md](../../TERMINOLOGY.md).)

**Which graphs a scope can name (found building W0).** Segment-prefix
matching fits a participant's nested world, whose node ids *are* scope paths:
the same strings `Gate::petition` already scope-checks. Mere's main graph
keys nodes by `Uuid`, and a UUID is one opaque segment, so against that
journal a `ScopePath` can only ever name one exact node or (via the root)
everything. Watching a *region* of the main graph therefore needs a region
vocabulary that does not exist yet. This does not block the matcher, which
takes events rather than a journal, but it does gate W2: see W0.5.

### 3.2 Triggers ride the journal, not edges

A watch matches **committed, attributed deltas**, never live mutation. The
matcher holds a per-watch cursor into `GraphJournal` and, at each drain,
tests entries `(cursor, live_cursor]` against the watch scope. Two built-in
refusals:

- **Self-authored entries never match the author's own watch.** The trivial
  self-loop is unrepresentable rather than budgeted. One trap here, found
  building W0: the two journals label the same subject differently.
  chartulary carries `denizen:abcd1234` (`Subject::to_author`), while mere's
  `GraphJournal` carries the full 64-char hex (turnstone
  `remote_projection.rs`). A derived label would be right on one tier and
  quietly wrong on the other, and being wrong means this refusal stops
  working while the budget silently absorbs the spin. So the label is a
  registration argument: a caller states which convention its journal uses.
- Entries authored `pre-gate` match normally (they are ordinary history by
  the time a watch exists).

App-tier watches (on `AppEvent`, e.g. "a session switched") are the same
shape at the observe drain, and land in a later slice; the graph tier comes
first because attribution and scopes already exist there.

**Watches are reviewed at install** (ruled 2026-08-13): they ride the pack
manifest beside the rings, so the review screen shows *when this runs* next
to *what it may touch* before either is granted. A watch added after
install is a widening and re-reviews, the same posture pack upgrades
already have. Registration still enforces the containment law regardless of
how the watch arrived.

### 3.3 The cascade runner

Firing a behavior produces petitions; petitions commit; commits can wake
other watches. That chain is a **cascade**, and it runs at the existing
after-dispatch drain, post-commit, per the chartulary consumer discipline:

1. Collect journal entries since each watch's cursor; compute the wake set.
2. Run woken behaviors **in stable subject order** (sorted subject hex),
   each as the existing `RunDenizen` lane with a trigger context supplied
   (the matched deltas, digested).
3. Their petitions commit through the gate as today, attributed to their
   subjects. Advance cursors.
4. Repeat from 1 with the new entries, up to the **cascade budget** of
   rounds. The budget is a setting (ruled 2026-08-13, per the
   configurability doctrine): default 4, live-switchable, floor 1; there is
   no "unlimited" value, because an unbounded cascade is the failure mode
   the budget exists to name. Exhausting it is loud: an `AppEvent` and a
   visible notice naming the behaviors still waking each other, per the
   no-silent-caps rule.

Termination is structural: finite rounds times a per-run step budget, plus
self-authored entries never re-waking their author. Determinism comes from
stable ordering plus single-threaded execution, which keeps cascades
scenario-replayable. This is the entire "scheduler": a bounded drain loop,
not a framework. Depth queues, backward-scheduling errors, and the rest of
the wavelet apparatus stay unbuilt unless cascades in practice grow real
dependency structure.

### 3.4 Time, later, honestly

"Untouched for a month", "archive orphans weekly" need a clock. Behaviors
get time only as a **watchable source injected at the drain** (the host's
clock today, a test/replay clock in harnesses), never by reading wall time
in a body, so a replayed session wakes the same behaviors at the same
points. This is the wavelet brief's replay-clock idea landing where it
earns its keep. Its own slice, last, because nothing above depends on it.

### 3.5 What a behavior may not do

Carried over or ruled here:

- No raw positions in, no positions out ("nearby" belongs to the projection
  tier or to a host-answered field query; gate-plan ruling, unchanged).
- No watch on another participant's grant projections (the gate already refuses
  writes there; watches are refused symmetrically, so authority changes
  cannot be used as a signal channel).
- Notifications emitted by behaviors are real or absent, never decorative
  (the no-placebo rule).
- Derived indexes (cited-by counts, backlink maps) are not behaviors. The
  doctrine already classes reverse maps as indexes owned by the kernel;
  writing them as truth via automation would mint divergence.

## 4. Slices

- **W0: watch table and matcher (headless, kernel-side). LANDED
  2026-08-13.** Built in `servitor` (`src/watch.rs`), which already owns
  `Cap`, `Grant`, and the `AuthorityProvider` seam a watch is contained by.
  `Watch { subject, scope, self_author, cursor }`, a `WatchTable` whose
  `register` enforces the containment law against
  `AuthorityProvider::covers(.., Mode::Read)`, and a `wake(events)` matcher
  returning wakes in stable subject order. Persistence is servitor's own
  `to_wire`/`parse` idiom rather than a serde dependency (space-separated,
  scope last, because a scope segment may contain a colon and `Cap`'s wire
  form could not carry one unambiguously). The matcher takes `WatchEvent`s
  rather than a journal type, so it serves both tiers.
- **W0.5: the main graph's region vocabulary. RULED: container membership
  (Mark, 2026-08-13).** Containment is already real in the kernel:
  `EdgeFamily::Containment` with seven sub-kinds (`UrlPath`, `Domain`,
  `FileSystem`, `UserFolder`, `ClipSource`, `NotebookSection`,
  `CollectionMember`), so this is a vocabulary the graph has rather than one
  to invent. The design that follows: **a node's watch scope is its
  containment ancestry**, written as a `ScopePath` of UUIDs
  (`containerUuid/memberUuid/...`). Segment-prefix coverage then means what
  it should with no change to `Cap`: a watch naming a container covers
  everything under it, transitively, and a watch naming the full path covers
  exactly one node. Two details the implementation settles, neither a
  blocker: a node reachable by several containment sub-kinds has *several*
  ancestry paths, which `WatchEvent.scopes` already accommodates by being a
  slice; and a node removed by the delta being matched has no ancestry left
  to compute, so it falls back to its own id as a single segment (matching an
  exact-node watch or the root, and nothing else). The adapter lives host-side
  in turnstone, which has both the graph and the journal; putting it in
  graph-kernel would drag personae's crypto into a wasm-clean crate through
  servitor. Unblocks W2.
- **W1a: the cascade runner itself (headless). LANDED 2026-08-13.** The
  bounded rounds loop of 3.3, in `servitor::cascade`: `CascadeBudget` (a
  setting, floored at 1, no unlimited value), `run_cascade` taking a
  host-supplied runner closure so no body-running lives here, and a
  `Cascade { rounds, outcome }` whose `BudgetExhausted` names the subjects
  still waking each other. Exhaustion **defers** rather than consumes: the
  naming peek (`WatchTable::would_wake`) advances no cursor, so work a
  cascade ran out of budget for is still there on the next drain.
- **W1b: wire it to the drain (turnstone). MOSTLY LANDED 2026-08-13.**
  `src/behaviors.rs` is the adapter and the drain: `touched_ids` (exhaustive
  over all 44 `CapturedDelta` variants, so a new one fails to compile until
  classified), `ancestry_scopes` (W0.5's containment walk), `entries_since`,
  and `drain`. `App::update` now splits into `dispatch` plus the drain, so a
  woken body sees the world the action left. Woken subjects run through
  `run_denizen_for_cascade`, which is the ordinary `RunDenizen` lane by
  another name: a behavior is a participant whose run was triggered, and a second
  path would mean a second set of rules. Exhaustion reports as
  `AppEvent::CascadeExhausted`, naming the residents by label.
  **The budget is a settings row (2026-08-13).** `ApplicationSettings`
  (in `pandect`, renamed from session-runtime) carries `cascade_budget`,
  serde-defaulted to 4; a number row exposes it with a floor of 1 and no
  unlimited value; and it rides the live snapshot the shell already polls, so
  a change reaches the next cascade with no restart. It is assigned outside
  the chrome comparison that decides whether to relayout, since a budget
  change needs none. **Remaining:** the headed scenario receipt.
  Done when: a two-behavior mutual-wake fixture terminates at the budget
  with the loud event on screen; a linear A-wakes-B chain settles in one
  cascade; every behavior-authored entry in the journal reads back with the
  right subject; the whole cascade replays deterministically in a scenario
  run; lowering the budget setting from 4 to 1 takes effect on the next
  cascade without a restart. (The headless halves of the first two and of the
  budget clause are covered by W1a; what remains is the wiring and the headed
  receipt.)
- **W2: trigger context into the body. MOSTLY LANDED 2026-08-13.** A woken
  body reads `mere.trigger()`, beside `mere.snapshot()` and gated on the same
  `app.read` capability because it describes the graph. It returns a
  `TriggerContext`: per matched entry, the journal seq, the author, and the
  node ids that moved. A **digest, not the deltas**, so a body is not coupled
  to the kernel's 44 variants or their evolution; and the nodes are each
  scope's *last* segment, since ancestry is written outermost-first and the
  tail is what actually changed. A hand-invoked run gets an empty context
  rather than a missing one, so a script can always ask. Uninstall now calls
  `WatchTable::remove_subject`: residency, authority, and standing
  subscriptions end together.
  The **install review now names the watch** (the ruled condition): a pack
  declares `-- @watch <url>` in its source, the review row reads "wakes on:
  <url>" beside the rings, and confirming registers it. Three properties fall
  out rather than being built: the declaration is an *address* because an
  author cannot know a UUID (install resolves it, minting the target with
  `visit` if absent); it lives *in the source*, and the subject is
  `blake3(source)`, so changing what a pack wakes on changes its identity and
  re-reviews; and `install_caps` grants a READ scope over the watched region,
  so the containment law holds by construction rather than by hope.
  **The inbox rule works (2026-08-13).** A node appearing under a watched
  folder wakes its behavior with nobody asking, and the edit lands attributed
  to the participant rather than the user: containment derived at mint, ancestry
  read as a scope, the watch matched, the cascade run at the drain, the body's
  Action lowered through the ordinary spine. W2 is closed except for a headed
  receipt, which the scenario lane can capture whenever it is wanted. The
  original text follows. The matched-delta digest handed to
  the piccolo body (and the wasm envelope, same shape as an Action payload);
  bindings stay capability-derived. First product behavior: an **inbox
  rule** (a node appearing under a watched scope is filed/tagged by
  petition). Done when: the install review screen shows the watch beside
  the rings before anything is granted; the inbox rule runs headed; its
  edit is attributed in the inspector; and uninstalling the participant removes
  the watch with it.
- **W2.5: containment is only derived on load. RULED (option 1) and LANDED
  2026-08-13.** `Graph::derive_containment_for` asserts a new node's URL-path
  parent at mint, called from both mint paths, so containment means the same
  thing live and loaded (mere-kernel: 282 pass). The **Domain half stays with
  the whole-graph rebuild**: a domain anchor is the shallowest node on a host,
  so minting one node can re-anchor every other node sharing it, which is not
  a local fact. Two consequences worth carrying: `containment_parent_url`
  covers `http`/`https`/`file` only, so a `mere://` folder still derives
  nothing; and it names a parent in **directory form**, so a folder addressed
  `.../inbox` rather than `.../inbox/` contains nothing and its watch is
  silently inert. The original ruling text follows.
- **W2.5 (original):** Found trying
  to build the inbox rule. The ruled region vocabulary rests on
  `EdgeFamily::Containment` edges, and in mere those edges are *derived from
  URL structure* by `Graph::rebuild_derived_containment_relations`, which is
  `pub(crate)` and has exactly one caller: `snapshot/from.rs`, the load path.
  Nothing derives containment when a node is visited, and `Canvas` exposes
  `graph()` and `facets_mut()` but no way for the app to assert a relation.
  So a node visited under `mere://inbox` gains no containment edge until the
  session is saved and reloaded, its ancestry stays a bare id, and the folder's
  watch never matches. The wake machinery is fine; the region it watches is not
  materialized in a live session. Three ways out:
  1. **Derive incrementally on visit** (recommended): give `Canvas` a method
     that asserts the new node's URL-path and domain parents at creation, and
     have `visit` call it. Containment then means the same thing live and
     loaded, which is the property the watch actually needs. Today's
     rebuild is whole-graph, so this wants the per-node form, not a call to
     the existing function.
  2. **Derive in the behaviors adapter**: `ancestry_scopes` falls back to URL
     parents when no edge exists. No kernel change, but it duplicates the
     derivation rule in a second place, and the two would drift.
  3. **Leave it**: watches match only after a reload. Cheapest and wrong; a
     behavior that works tomorrow but not today is worse than one that says
     it does not work.
  Whichever is chosen, an end-to-end inbox-rule test and its headed receipt
  follow immediately: every other link in the chain is already proven.
- **W3: app-tier watches. LANDED 2026-08-13** (turnstone `4fbd17c`; 271
  pass). A pack declares `-- @watch app/<event-name>` and wakes on it with no
  polling. The `app/` prefix is the whole distinction between an event scope
  and an address, and cannot collide with a graph scope because those are UUID
  paths. The name comes from `AppEvent::describe`'s first token rather than a
  second 52-arm match that could disagree with what the transcript shows.
  **The app tier has its own `WatchTable`**: a watch cursor is a position in
  one journal, and a `GraphJournal` sequence and an app-event ordinal are
  different counters. **The ordinal must be monotonic**: numbering events by
  their index in the queue the shell empties each frame made every event after
  the first drain look older than the watch had seen, so nothing woke again.
  Self-waking is refused here too, by attributing a body's own events to it.
  The original text follows.
- **W3 (original):** `AppEvent` watches at the observe drain, ring
  vocabulary unchanged. Done when: a behavior wakes on `SessionSwitched`
  without polling, and the scenario log shows the wake attributed.
- **W4: time watches. LANDED 2026-08-13** (servitor `tick.rs` in mere
  `afc11b07`, host half in turnstone `c408c81`; 59 and 275 pass). A pack
  declares `-- @watch every/hour`. **Schedules are not `Watch`es**: a watch is
  a cursor into a journal and time has no entries to point one at, so forcing
  ticks through the matcher would mean minting synthetic entries to match.
  The clock is the host's and is fed in, never sampled, and a body has no
  binding that reads one (pinned by probing `os.time`, `os.clock`,
  `mere.now`), which is what makes replay fire identically. A host with no
  clock fires nothing rather than reading "no time" as time zero. **A tick
  needs no capability**, deliberately: being woken by a region reveals that
  the region changed, being woken by the clock reveals nothing; what a
  schedule costs is resource, gated by the review naming the period. Install
  is not a tick, a missed period is not made up, and a backwards clock fires
  nothing. A scheduled body gets an empty trigger context, which is truer than
  handing it the last unrelated change. The original text follows.
- **W4 (original):** The injected time source of 3.4 plus a test clock.
  Done when: a "stale scope" behavior fires under a test clock stepped past
  the threshold, fires identically on replay, and never fires from a body
  reading wall time (no such binding exists).
- **W5: the flagship. LANDED 2026-08-13** (turnstone `ae4fa4a`, canvas setter
  in mere `1d2cf96c`; 278 pass). A behavior watching a container writes a note
  when its members change, attributed to itself, and stops on revocation with
  the standing note intact. The digest is plain text; the intel seam replaces
  the prose without changing the shape.
  **It needed an authoring lane that did not exist**: a body could open,
  dispatch and summon but could not write content. `Action::WriteNote` plus
  `mere.write(url, text)` fills it, through the kernel's body delta so the
  write journals attributed. **Authoring earns its own ring** by the test
  `Place` already states in `ring.rs`: folding it into `Dispatch` would have
  widened every already-installed pack's grant, because `default_rings`
  preselects Dispatch. `Author` is not preselected either. Two things found
  here: `update` became dispatch-plus-drain in W1b and
  `lower_denizen_actions` lowers through `update`, so **running a body
  re-enters the drain** (the graph tier survived by accident, the clock and
  app tiers would have fired mid-cascade; a `draining` flag makes it
  structural); and a **constant digest journals nothing after the first
  write**, because an unchanged body is not a change. The original text
  follows.
- **W5 (original):** Read scope
  over a container's members, write scope over one note node, waking on
  member changes; summarization via a host-provided capability (the intel
  seam: esp is the stated successor to vates/sibylla, so the capability
  fronts esp; a plain-text digest body is the fallback if the intel seam is
  not ready, and the behavior shape is identical). Done when: editing a
  watched node updates the summary note within one cascade, the note's
  history shows every update attributed to the summarizer, and revoking the
  grant stops updates with the standing note intact.

## 5. The candidate catalog

The "ten neat lil ideas", each placed. Tier: **P** = projection rule (field
regions plan), **B** = graph behavior (this plan), **I** = index (kernel,
not automation).

| idea | tier | trigger | needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| nearby nodes refresh | P | spatial region | field regions plan |
| neighborhood summary into a knot note | B | delta (W5) | intel capability |
| inbox rule: new node under scope → file/tag | B | delta (W2) | nothing new |
| staleness badge on old nodes | P | time | projection + clock |
| gardening: petition to archive orphans | B | time (W4) | compensating action |
| auto-tag on content | B | delta | intel capability |
| watch-and-notify | B | delta | honest notify capability |
| rollup counts displayed on a container | P | delta | projection only |
| rollup written back as node content | B | delta | scope discipline |
| template expansion on drop | B | delta | nothing new |
| cited-by / backlink counts | I | not triggered | kernel index, never a behavior |
| cross-app: woodshed practice event → knot journal line | B (far) | app event | murm lane; out of scope here |

## 6. Non-goals

- Operative edges or edge-kind variants in any data or display graph. The
  2026-08-13 brief's retraction stands; agency lives in participants.
- A general scheduler. The cascade runner is a bounded drain loop; wavelet's
  depth machinery waits for evidence of need.
- New scripting languages or lanes. rhai / piccolo / wasm as placed.
- Spatial influence through petitions (numen fields remain the path).
- Universal undo (gate-plan posture: attribution + compensating actions).
- Cross-app and peer-carried behaviors (the pack/moot distribution story
  already covers how a behavior travels; wiring its *triggers* across murm
  or retinue is its own future plan).

## 7. Rulings (all three open questions closed 2026-08-13)

1. **The noun is watch.** Recorded in TERMINOLOGY.md beside participant and
   petition.
2. **Watches are reviewed at install**, in the pack manifest beside the
   rings; post-install additions are widenings and re-review (folded into
   3.2).
3. **The cascade budget is a setting**: default 4 rounds, live-switchable,
   floor 1, no unlimited value (folded into 3.3). W1's done conditions gain
   one clause: changing the setting takes effect on the next cascade
   without a restart.

## 8. Servitor resident and run redesign (2026-09-20)

**Status:** proposed design, grounded in current consumers. The user reopened
crate boundaries after the procedural-graphs discussion; this section records
the recommended design rather than treating the old boundaries as fixed.
*Participant* names admission through the gate; *servitor* names a resident
helper. *Denizen* belongs to the Isometry simulation family.

### 8.1 Findings and the boundary to move

The current `crates/servitor/src/lib.rs` exports authority, watch, tick,
cascade and deadband primitives. The cascade's runner closure leaves body
execution to the host. Turnstone's `turnstone/src/denizen.rs` owns resident bindings and
reconstruction; `turnstone/src/app/denizen_arms.rs` selects a script/component, evaluates
it, applies the deadband, and lowers returned actions. Its
`turnstone/src/app/palette.rs` attributes those actions to the participant. These are
real script consumers, not proof of a durable model-driven run.

Move **the meaning and state of a resident run** into Servitor: its cause,
version bindings, decision/effect sequencing, pause and termination reasons,
budgets, and procedure adoption. The host supplies observation, execution,
persistence, and product actions through explicit adapters. A pure reducer
consumes recorded inputs and produces requests; it does not own a thread or
perform I/O. Armillary can drive it, as can a deterministic scenario harness.

Two recovery seams need attention before resumable automation: Turnstone's
`turnstone/src/behaviors.rs` advances the graph cursor before running bodies, and
`turnstone/src/denizen.rs` (`rebuild`) can reissue certificates from grant projections when
stored chains do not verify. The latter was written for historical install
and profile migrations; it must not become the recovery rule for a paused or
revoked resident. New lifecycle/authority records must make those cases
distinguishable before R1 admits resumed work.

| Owner | Responsibility after the proposed change |
| --- | --- |
| Servitor | Resident and run records; trigger/run coordination; procedure schema and local retrieval; optional guidance protocol; candidate evaluation requirements and adoption rules |
| Servitor authority modules | Existing participant checks and Chartulary petition adapter, independently callable by scripts and peers |
| Personae / capability | Identity, signed delegation, revocation and permission algebra |
| Chartulary / Eidetic | Graph and journal primitives, artifact storage, provenance and retrieval substrates; Servitor defines its record semantics |
| Armillary | Actor threads, channels and message delivery; Servitor decides whether retrying or accepting a late result is valid |
| ESP | Model execution and provider-specific streaming/cancellation; it supplies neither resident authority nor run policy |
| Host / Djinn | Product registry and effect handlers, graph adapters, installation, settings, process lifetime and storage composition |
| Distillery | Optional compute for refinement/evaluation jobs; the resident's owner determines the adoption policy |

Start with module boundaries in the existing Servitor crate. Authority-only
consumers such as Gemot and document-host must not acquire an ESP, model,
thread-runtime or host dependency. Feature-gate integration adapters if they
become necessary. Extract another crate only when dependency direction or a
real independent consumer requires it; the reassigned `denizen` name is not
available for this platform work.

### 8.2 Separate identity, definition and execution

Proposed concepts below are illustrative schema names, not implemented APIs:

| Record | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ResidentId` | One installed helper instance in its owning space |
| `Subject` | Authority principal supplied by the existing admission path |
| `BodyRef` / `ProcedureRef` | Immutable, versioned behavior artifacts that may be shared by many residents |
| `ResidentBinding` | Resident, subject, selected artifact versions, settings and owner-approved adoption policy |
| `RunId` / `StepId` | One invocation and its ordered work, distinct from the resident and authority principal |
| `RunRecord` | Cause, pinned versions, observed inputs/results, outstanding requests, resource usage and current disposition |

Turnstone currently hashes the installed pack bytes into `Subject` in
`turnstone/src/denizen.rs` (`stage_install`); editing a pack therefore creates a different
subject and demands fresh grant review. This is a migration constraint, not a
reason to silently preserve authority across arbitrary code changes. Import
existing subjects and bindings unchanged. A future stable resident ID is an
additional instance identity, never a substitute signing key. Binding an
updated body or procedure is a separate authorized, version-checked adoption
event; its policy explicitly decides whether existing grants suffice.
Eidetic's existing `PackManifest` already separates author, version and content
IDs. Reuse that artifact provenance; a publisher's signature does not itself
identify the installed resident or confer its grants. Typed trigger declarations
belong in a versioned descriptor, with adapters for today's Lua annotations;
do not copy Turnstone's URL/app-source parsing into Servitor.

Two residents may use one procedure artifact while retaining different
subjects, scopes, settings, histories and current steps. A run pins the
body/procedure versions and relevant settings at start. Grant validity remains
live: pause/resume does not freeze permission, and every consequential dispatch
must recheck current authority and product preconditions.
Wake/run routing uses resident IDs separately from subjects: Turnstone's current
`turnstone/src/behaviors.rs` (`member_of`) searches for a resident by subject, so identical
packs can make that lookup ambiguous. Import must explicitly bind the instance
or refuse ambiguity rather than select an arbitrary HashMap entry.

### 8.3 The run contract

Use explicit states for ready, deciding, awaiting a host result, paused,
reconciling an uncertain effect, and terminal. Completion, refusal, cancellation,
failure and budget exhaustion are distinct recorded terminal reasons. A wake
records manual invocation, journal identity plus matched sequence positions,
or a host-clock tick; sequence numbers alone cannot identify a source across
journals. A resident's overlap setting chooses reject, queue or coalesce;
queued/coalesced causes are recorded and ordered, with bounded queue size.
Pausing a resident is distinct from pausing one run or revoking its authority.
The owner chooses whether wakes during resident pause are skipped with a
recorded summary or accumulated in a bounded queue. Cursor advancement and
the corresponding disposition must be durably associated. Reloading a watch
does not prove its current read authority; recheck before collecting context
as well as before writing or dispatching an effect.

Each outbound request carries run ID, step ID, attempt and binding generation.
The reducer rejects duplicate, stale and post-cancellation results. Cancelling
requests cooperative provider shutdown and prevents further dispatch; it does
not claim that a running external operation was undone. Armillary's channel
closure alone is not a receipt that a model call has stopped.

Record intent before dispatch and the actual result afterward. Host adapters
declare whether an operation is read-only, deduplicated by a stable operation
ID, or needs reconciliation when its outcome is unknown. Replay reconstructs
state from recorded results; it must not resend effects. A crash between an
external effect and its receipt enters reconciliation, never blind retry.
This requires host commit/effect integration, not merely a transcript writer.
The current Chartulary `Gate` applies nested-graph edits; it cannot authorize
or atomically commit every Turnstone or external action by itself.
Run attribution must accompany each commit. Turnstone's synchronous lowering
temporarily changes the journal's current author; carrying that mutable author
context across asynchronous waits would misattribute concurrent work.

Durable owner decisions and verified certificate/revocation evidence are
distinct from their graph projections. Reopening a suspended or revoked resident
must preserve that disposition. Legacy recovery needs explicit migration
provenance and must never treat an unverifiable chain or readable grant
projection alone as permission to issue fresh authority.

Budgets cover decisions, model tokens, tool calls, elapsed host time and
consecutive failures, with counters surviving pause/restart. Resume checks the
current binding, authority and cancellation state. The host supplies time and
observations for deterministic replay. Cascades continue to limit reactions
between residents; a run budget limits work inside one invocation. Slow model
work must yield rather than hold a synchronous cascade drain open; completion
returns as a recorded event for a later bounded drain.

### 8.4 Procedures and revision

The [Procedural Graphs paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2609.09153v1) motivates
local procedural retrieval, guidance during a run, and evaluated revision
between runs. Its graph is frozen while solving, and its edges provide advice
to the solver. This design borrows that separation; the following typed
contracts and authority rules are our adaptation, not claims from the paper.

A proposed `ProcedureGraphV1` contains stable nodes for registered actions,
observable checks and task states; edges carry condition, guidance and pitfall
annotations. Registry IDs and schema versions are validated at binding and
use. Typed checks name host-provided predicates; free-form condition text is
advice and cannot become an executable permission check. Procedure progression
and success conditions must cite observations/results, not a model's assertion
that it succeeded. Localize by typed action/result references; an unmatched
state is explicit. Retrieval depth, history window and token cap are settings,
with a bounded fallback when localization fails.

The procedure graph is optional. A scripted driver and a model-guided driver
share the run contract. The latter may choose an authorized action beyond the
suggested neighborhood; graph edges are not a replacement permission system.
Invoking a reusable subprocedure shares the parent's budget and authority
ceiling, and has a bounded recursion depth. Record the retrieved artifact and
guidance used so the decision can be inspected without rerunning inference.

Refinement creates an inert candidate artifact citing its base version and
supporting runs. Servitor defines a versioned evaluation request and result
schema: task/fixture set, provider and registry identities, settings, success,
refusal, repetition and resource measurements. Distillery may execute it;
Eidetic retains evidence. The host's adopted policy chooses explicit review or
bounded automatic adoption with declared thresholds. Compare-and-adopt checks
the current binding version, evidence applicability and adoption authority.
Rejection remains recorded; a delayed result cannot overwrite a newer adopted
version. Active runs keep their pinned versions. Adoption cannot rewrite grants
or bypass the independently enforced authority path.

### 8.5 Implementation slices and done-conditions

1. **R1a: resident binding and run admission.** Add inert resident/revision,
   lifecycle, trigger and run-ticket contracts. Adapt Turnstone's existing
   resident lookup and one scenario lane. Prove unique instance routing,
   explicit pause/backlog disposition, current read/write authority and legacy
   identity preservation. Persist revocation/lifecycle evidence so reopening
   cannot revive denied work. This slice adds no new external-effect replay.
2. **R1b: shared run reducer and outcomes.** Drive the contract with the scenario
   adapter and a deterministic provider fixture. Prove bounded work, cancellation,
   stale-result refusal, per-commit attribution, durable intent/result ordering
   and replay without repeat effects. Exercise uncertain-outcome reconciliation
   before enabling resumable external effects. Existing authority consumers
   remain usable without model/runtime features through both R1 slices.
3. **R2: optional procedural guidance.** Add artifact validation and bounded
   local retrieval. Two residents reuse the same version with different grants
   and independent progress. Compare flat context with procedural guidance on
   the same task set; record success, invalid/repeated actions, steps, tokens
   and latency. Invalid action IDs and fabricated completion fail closed. A
   live ESP provider supplies a measured receipt before claiming model benefit.
4. **R3: evaluated adoption.** Create candidates from recorded failures,
   evaluate on separately held-out tasks, and exercise both rejection and
   owner-authorized adoption. Prove evidence/version mismatch refusal, adoption
   races, unchanged active-run versions, and cancellation/revocation while
   evaluation is outstanding. Never claim statistical improvement from one
   deterministic fixture or reuse validation tasks as the final test set.

R1a and R1b are the current source implementation slices. R2/R3 describe the extension
points it must leave available, not requirements to implement all learning
machinery before one resident runs. Executable gates remain pending the user's
existing Cargo and process hold.

### 8.6 R1a source implementation and remaining gates

Servitor's `resident` module carries host-supplied instance, principal, body
revision, generation, lifecycle and trigger values. Admission checks the current
authority provider. A ticket retains the original required capabilities;
revalidation checks those requirements as well as any new ones and refuses a
changed binding. The ticket is a snapshot. Hosts still authorize each action.

Turnstone owns the session lifecycle sidecar and adapts its existing resident
execution path. The first backlog policy is skip while paused, with a persisted
count; resuming does not replay skipped triggers. Lifecycle state and delegation
certificates remain separate from browsable grant projections. Reopening must
not turn a missing certificate or a malformed lifecycle record into fresh
authority. Forks remap instance IDs while carrying lifecycle state; copying a
resident's graph does not itself delegate permission in the child session.
Reversible node archival retains that lifecycle state for recovery. Uninstall
records revocation; recovery cannot turn a revoked record back into active state.
Installation records denial before writing reviewed certificates and publishes
active state last, so a failed transition leaves work denied.

Component hosting accepts held bytes so the body whose revision was checked is
the body instantiated. This is an adapter improvement within the existing
component lane, not a new effect or model runtime.

**Validation and source identity:** unit and consumer regression tests are
source changes awaiting execution. Static review cannot establish compilation,
headed behavior, crash recovery or physical power-loss durability. Turnstone's
existing `.cargo/config.local.toml` and `scripts/cargo_mode.py local` provide
the sibling-source development lane; neither Cargo nor that launcher was run.
The portable manifest pins and lockfiles still name the older Mere revision.
Before portable acceptance, commit the shared sources, align the Mere dependency
family to one revision, regenerate locks through Cargo, then execute focused
Servitor and Turnstone gates after the hold is lifted. Do not hand-author a lock
receipt or mix old and new shared authority types across source identities.

R1b extends admission with durable run intent and outcomes, cancellation,
stale-result refusal and uncertain-effect reconciliation. Passing admission alone
does not make retries or interrupted external effects safe.

### 8.7 R1b implementation boundary

The portable run reducer owns deterministic state transitions over recorded
events. Its header retains the admitted ticket, a host-assigned run ID, starting
time and budget limits. Correlations name run, step, attempt and binding
generation. The host also supplies the run-ID namespace, such as the session;
a numeric run ID alone cannot identify work across sessions. Applying history
reconstructs state and counters. It does not return executable actions or retry
commands.

Run limits are host inputs. Intents consume positive decision charges; the
consumer measures elapsed time and reserves capacity for recording returned
effects. Observed usage can exceed a limit, and its receipt remains recordable.
This accounting does not preempt a synchronous evaluator: existing script
instruction and component runtime bounds remain separate execution controls.

Intent precedes evaluation or application dispatch. Observed results follow it.
Cancellation denies further work while retaining unresolved consequential
operations. Recovery of an interrupted consequential operation requires explicit
reconciliation; neither a restart nor elapsed budget is evidence that an effect
failed or was undone. The deterministic provider fixture exercises the protocol
without a model backend. Executable receipts remain pending the Cargo hold.

Turnstone must distinguish three observations: a synchronous application action
was applied, an effect was handed to a port, and that effect actually completed.
In particular, `Effect::SaveSession` is a request to the shell; the existing
best-effort save path is not a durable graph-commit acknowledgement. A durable
run record can preserve the observation of a local action without certifying
that the corresponding graph snapshot reached disk.

The first adapter records synchronous invocations and labels returned effects
as released for untracked handoff by default. That preserves ordinary repeated helpers
without inventing external completion evidence. Strict effect tracking is an
explicit host option: unresolved consequential work blocks another invocation
of the same resident until the host records a resolution. Cancellation alone
does not settle that uncertainty. Run records retain references and dispositions,
not copies of document bodies or credentials. Configurable storage limits refuse further work
rather than silently discarding unresolved records. The run store remains live
through nested cascades; interruption recovery occurs only on session adoption.
Forks start a fresh run namespace. These controls currently enter through host
configuration APIs; a new settings UI is not part of this slice.

**Remaining acceptance boundaries:** portable dependency pins, compilation and
regression execution remain held. Correlated port completion callbacks and a
fallible graph-persistence acknowledgement are still required before claiming
end-to-end durable effects. R2 procedural guidance and R3 evaluated adoption
remain subsequent slices; they must not infer successful actions from a model's
text or a queued port request.

## Progress

- 2026-09-20: reviewed current Servitor/Turnstone consumers and proposed the
  resident/run redesign in section 8. Separated principal, instance and artifact
  versions; assigned run semantics to Servitor and execution mechanics to
  adapters. R1a source implementation and adapter work followed in the same
  pass; see section 8.6 for the pending validation and dependency gates. R1b
  followed with the shared event reducer, session-owned run sidecar, correlated
  reconciliation and source regressions; section 8.7 records its boundaries.
  Static review and the incremental documentation audit passed. The new tests
  have not run under the Cargo hold.

- 2026-08-18 (frequency bound / signaling target 3 complete): deadband belongs
  to **actuation**. Suppressing a watch cannot protect the journal from a
  scheduled or hand-run writer. A behavior may now declare `-- @deadband
  <minimum-change> <minimum-interval-ms>` and report exactly one signed scalar
  in its own stable units through `mere.output(value)`. Servitor owns the
  positive-dimension declaration, persisted last-accepted output and host-fed
  instant, named refusal, and two-phase `Gate::petition_behavior`: check before
  commit, move the baseline only after the subject's graph entry lands. This
  preserves replay and means a stale revision conflict does not consume the
  interval. Turnstone shows the declaration in install review, routes manual,
  watch and scheduled resident runs through the same check before action
  lowering, persists the state beside watches, and removes it on uninstall.
  The named slow-cycle receipt runs long-separated `0/1` outputs and leaves the
  graph revision unchanged; the host receipt writes once, reloads the session,
  then names the deadband refusal without growing the journal. Servitor is
  65/65 with warning-denied Clippy; Turnstone is 316 passed and 4 explicitly
  ignored endpoint receipts. These are automated library receipts, not a new
  headed scenario.

- 2026-08-16 (the frequency gap, from the facet signaling round): this plan
  bounds cascade **depth** and nothing bounds cascade **frequency**. A search
  across servitor for rate, throttle, debounce, hysteresis, deadband, cooldown
  and period returns only `CascadeBudget`, and this plan carries no such
  language either, so the hole is in the design rather than merely unbuilt. The
  failure it admits is a slow limit cycle: a behavior that settles and then
  re-triggers a second later, forever, never exhausts a budget that counts
  rounds *within* one cascade, because each individual cascade is short. It
  costs more here than in an ordinary reactive system, because the graph is the
  replay of the journal: an oscillating behavior writes history, so load and
  replay stay inflated after the behavior is fixed or deleted, and deleting the
  participant does not shrink the journal it wrote. Suggested shape is a **declared
  deadband** (a minimum change, a minimum interval) on the behavior rather than
  discipline each modder reinvents correctly, which also fits the existing
  posture that the budget is a setting with no unlimited value. Closed
  2026-08-18 at actuation: that side also bounds writers that were never woken.
  Recorded with its reasoning in
  [facet signaling and control loops](../technical_architecture/2026-08-16_facet_signaling_and_control_loops.md)
  §6; no code changed.

- 2026-08-13 (watch persistence): watches did not survive a session reload.
  Every registration site was inside install, and rebuild-on-adopt put the
  residents back without their subscriptions, so a behavior installed today
  silently stopped waking after a restart. **Persisted rather than re-derived
  from the pack source**, which would also have worked: what re-deriving loses
  is that a rebuilt graph watch restarts its cursor at zero and re-wakes on
  history it already considered, and a rebuilt schedule restarts its period,
  so a daily behavior never fires for anyone who reopens their session each
  morning. Cursors and phase are state, not declaration. One tagged file
  beside the bindings and certificates (a table is read and written whole, so
  per-subject files would mean a directory scan); saved at install, uninstall,
  and any drain that produced effects; restored at all three adopt sites.
  turnstone `bedd396`, 280 pass.

- 2026-08-13 (headed receipt): `behaviors_wake.scn` is green. It caught two
  things the unit tests could not. **A real fetch rewrites a node's URL out
  from under the watch that resolved to it**, so the first version, using
  `https://example.com/notes/`, never woke; the scenario uses `file:///`,
  which `containment_parent_url` covers equally and which does not depend on
  the network. That is the second time an *address* rather than a mechanism
  has broken a watch. And **the review row is clipped in the palette**: the
  capture reads "wakes on: fi...". It passes the `<96`-char guard in
  `denizen.rs`, which was itself added the last time a headed run clipped the
  ask, so that guard measures characters where the real limit is rendered
  width. Worth fixing, since the point of naming the watch in the review is
  that a reviewer can read it. **Still without headed receipts of their own:**
  the clock tier (needs a scenario clock verb), app-tier watches, and the
  budget setting.

- 2026-08-13 (W5, and the plan's slices complete): the summarizer runs. The
  ring decision is the one to remember: a new capability that would ride an
  existing preselected grant is not a new capability, it is a silent widening
  of every pack already installed. And the reentrancy the drain introduced in
  W1b was found only because W5 put a second tier under a running body.

- 2026-08-13 (W4): schedules landed. The shape worth keeping is that time got
  its own structure rather than being bent into the watch matcher, and that
  the capability asymmetry is stated rather than silently assumed: a scope
  watch is gated because it discloses, a schedule is gated because it costs.

- 2026-08-13 (W3): app-tier watches landed. The design fork worth keeping is
  the second table: sharing one with the graph tier would have let two seq
  spaces advance each other's cursors past unread work. The bug worth keeping
  is the ordinal, which a test caught: a queue index resets when the shell
  drains, a watch cursor does not, and the mismatch silently stops every wake
  after the first.

- 2026-08-13 (W1b closed): the cascade budget is persisted, exposed, and live
  (turnstone `8685ff0`, mere `e87ea99e`; 269 and 272 pass). One thing worth
  remembering: the new spec row went LAST in the list, because two existing
  tests assert specs by index and inserting in the middle renumbered them
  silently. The provider test now names the row rather than only counting it.

- 2026-08-13 (W2 closed): the inbox rule passes. The failure was none of the
  joins I suspected: instrumenting the drain showed the child's scope arriving
  as a bare id, because the folder was addressed `.../inbox` while the kernel
  names parents `.../inbox/`. An address mismatch, not a mechanism fault. The
  trap is now in the behaviors module docs, since it costs a silent watch and
  says nothing about why. **262 pass** with `--features piccolo`.
- 2026-08-13 (W2, last piece): stopped before building the inbox rule. The
  containment edges the ruled vocabulary rests on are derived only on snapshot
  load, so the rule cannot fire in a live session and a test cannot even stage
  the edge (no public assert path). Recorded as W2.5 with three options and a
  recommendation, rather than guessed at. Everything else in the chain is
  proven: 261 pass.

- 2026-08-13 (unblocking): gemot's group bridge still imported
  `IdentityHandle` and `OperationId` from `p2panda_auth::traits` after another
  session's bump to p2panda 0.7, which broke every crate downstream including
  turnstone. An actor is now `p2panda_core::identity::Author` and `OperationId`
  moved to `p2panda-core`; `Author` also requires serde where `IdentityHandle`
  did not, so `MootGroupHandle` derives it. Fixed in mere `38d5546a` (gemot:
  111 pass) because it blocked verifying anything at all, not because the
  subsystem is this plan's.

- 2026-08-13: plan written. Substrate grounded against journal.rs,
  commit.rs, gate.rs/cap.rs, denizen.rs/component.rs/ring.rs, observe.rs,
  all read this session. No code yet.
- 2026-08-13 (later): Mark ruled the three open questions (watch / install
  review / budget-as-setting); rulings folded into 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and
  TERMINOLOGY.md. W1 and W2 done conditions extended accordingly.
- 2026-08-13 (W0): landed in servitor. **43 tests pass** (32 existing plus
  11 new), clippy clean in servitor's own files. All four done conditions
  covered by name: containment enforced at registration (including the root
  scope refused as a loophole, and a `Write` grant accepted as covering the
  `Read` a watch needs), segment matching proven by `trail` not covering
  `trailer`, self-waking refused under both author conventions, and cursors
  proven to survive the wire round trip. Four beyond them: stable subject
  ordering (what cascade determinism rests on), uninstall taking watches with
  it, a malformed record failing the load rather than vanishing, and a
  colon-bearing scope surviving the wire form. Two findings folded into 3.1
  and 3.2, and W0.5 added: the main graph has no region vocabulary, so W2 is
  blocked until Mark rules one.
  Note for whoever runs the workspace clippy gate: `-D warnings` is red on
  personae's deprecated `chacha20poly1305` `from_slice` calls, which is
  pre-existing crypto-row residue and unrelated to this slice.
- 2026-08-13 (W0.5 ruled, W1a): Mark ruled container membership; the ancestry
  design above is written against `edge_taxonomy.rs`, which already carries
  `EdgeFamily::Containment`. `servitor::cascade` landed with it. **51 tests
  pass** (8 cascade, 11 watch, 32 existing). The cascade tests cover a chain
  settling, a two-scope relay settling, mutual waking stopping at the budget
  with both subjects named, deferred work surviving exhaustion, a budget of
  one, the floor, an empty wake set never calling the runner, and two
  identical runs producing identical rounds.
  One fixture was wrong before it was right, and the correction is the
  interesting part: the first "relay settles" test had both subjects watching
  the same scope with a runner that committed unconditionally, which is not a
  relay but two behaviors answering each other, and it correctly exhausted
  the budget. A real relay needs distinct scopes and a last link that writes
  where nobody is watching. The test now says so in its name.
- 2026-08-13 (W1b): the drain landed in turnstone. **236 tests pass**, 5 of
  them new, clippy clean in the touched files. Two findings from reading
  rather than assuming. **Containment points from the member to the
  container**: the kernel asserts `assert_relation(child, parent,
  Containment)`, so ancestry follows *outgoing* edges, and walking incoming
  ones would have built every watch tree upside down. And the delta grouping
  has five shapes, not four: `ReplayBranchHistoryByIds` carries
  `child_id`/`parent_id`, which a field-name sweep misses, so a history
  branch would have woken nobody.
- 2026-08-13 (W2): the trigger context landed in turnstone. **250 tests pass
  with `--features piccolo`** (up from 236 default), including a body that
  dispatches only when something woke it and refuses the digest without
  `app.read`. Two incidental finds. The **piccolo test lane did not compile at
  HEAD**: three `App.canvas` references outlived a rename to `graph_runtimes`,
  so `cargo test --features piccolo` had not been run in a while; fixed here
  because testing `mere.trigger()` required it. And the **sandbox carries no
  `string` library**, so the fixture compares against the empty wire form
  instead of searching it, with the exact form pinned by a unit test so the
  two fail together. The default lane's one red is a `place::lanes` timeout
  that passes alone in 8s, a flake under concurrent builds, and untouched by
  this work.
- 2026-08-13 (W2, review half): the watch declaration and install registration
  landed (turnstone `59573a6`), committed unverified because mere's tree was
  mid-migration in two sibling sessions and turnstone would not build.
  **Now verified: 261 pass with `--features piccolo`**, including
  `the_review_names_the_watch_and_confirming_registers_it` and the <96-char
  review-row guard, which the longer row still clears. One of the two blockers
  cleared on its own; the other needed fixing (below).
