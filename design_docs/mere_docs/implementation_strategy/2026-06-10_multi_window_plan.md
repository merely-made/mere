# Multi-Window Tear-Out Plan

**Date**: 2026-06-10
**Status**: MW1–MW3 **done** (the per-window reshape, the `WindowId` registry,
one-device/N-surfaces, spawn/close, slim leaf chrome — see Progress). **MW4–MW6 are
superseded** by the
[window composition plan (archived)](../../archive_docs/2026-06-19_completed_plans/2026-06-11_window_composition_plan.md), which reframes the
second window as **orrery (authority) vs panes (views that resolve to an orrery by
`graph_id`)** and pools the orrery off `Shell` by `GraphId` (the MW6 "IOU", brought
forward and converged with far-B) after finding the shared constellation is UUID-keyed
and graph-agnostic. The MW4–MW6 sections below are kept for history; read them through
that plan. This plan carved the window seam and staged leaf → branch → fork.
**Reframed 2026-07-05**: the N-runner/N-dom/N-ShellState shape this plan built is
now the *current* state, not the target. The
[one-state-N-windows design](../design/2026-07-05_one_state_n_windows_design.md)
names the next architecture: one runner, one app state, one forest dom, windows as
lenses; the chrome mirroring and spawn-time chip seeding this plan's machinery
required become the thing to delete.
**Related**: [tear-out operations brief](../research/2026-05-11_tearout_operations_brief.md) (the leaf/branch/fork model this implements), [multi-graph activation plan](2026-06-09_multi_graph_activation_plan.md) (MG6 lists this; far-B and multi-window share the per-window-view-over-shared-graph split), [peripheral panes architecture](../technical_architecture/2026-06-06_peripheral_panes_architecture.md) (panes are per-window). Code: `crates/meerkat/` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->, `crates/system/session-runtime/` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->, `crates/shell/frame/` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->.

Drag a pane or tile out of its window into a new OS window that shares the backing
graph + session state. The destination is the tear-out brief's trichotomy — **leaf**
(UI-only, drag), **branch** (new graphlet, Shift+drag), **fork** (new graph,
Ctrl+Shift+drag) — with a toast offering escalation on an unmodified drag. Leaf is
the first milestone; it needs the least new architecture.

This plan supersedes the never-written `2026-06-04_multi_window_plan.md` the
multi-graph plan referenced.

## Findings

**The host is a single-window god-struct.** `App` *is* the winit
`ApplicationHandler` ([app_handler.rs](../../../crates/meerkat/src/app_handler.rs) *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-link -->):
it holds one `window: Option<Arc<Window>>`, one `host: SurfaceHost`, and
`window_event` early-returns unless the event's `WindowId` matches that one window.
The `App` struct ([main.rs](../../../crates/meerkat/src/main.rs) *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-link -->) carries ~80 fields
that mix two concerns:

- **Shared session state** (one per app): the graph (today inside `orrery`), the
  `constellation` (content-tile actors), the `fetch`/`sync`/`comms` actor handles +
  the `inbox`, the durable content `store`, `manifests` + the session registry, the
  `theme` registry + `engine_registry`, `observability`, `diagnostics_rx`, `_kernel`.
- **Per-window view state**: `window` + `host` (surface), the chrome `runner` + `dom`
  (each window has its own toolbar / omnibar), `frame_layout`, the camera (inside
  `orrery`), the ~15 `*_rects` / `*_textures` hit-and-paint caches, `cursor`,
  `modifiers`, the drag states (`tab_drag`, `divider_drag`, `frame_divider_drag`,
  `resize_drag`, `titlebar_press`), `width`/`height`, `toolbar_h`, `cursor_icon`,
  `maximized_pane`, `active_content`, `renaming`, the switcher caches
  (`session_thumbnails` / `session_labels` / `session_*_rects`), `shellbar_edge`.

**The orrery is the crux.** `Orrery` bundles the graph + offloaded physics + camera.
Multi-window-over-shared-graph wants the *graph + physics* shared and the *camera +
input + render* per-window. That split is exactly what far-B needs too (the
multi-graph plan: "multi-window compounds with far-B"). It is the single hardest
piece, so the staging defers it.

**Leaf side-steps the orrery split.** Per the tear-out brief §4.1, a **leaf** window
is *workbench-only, no orrery*: it shows a tile facet of a node that still lives in
the donor's graph. Rendering a tile needs the node's URL + its content actor, both of
which live in the **shared** `constellation` + graph — not a second orrery. So leaf
tear-out is reachable without extracting the graph from the orrery, as long as the
constellation and a read view of the graph are shared.

**The substrate is payload-only.** `tearout.rs` ships `TileDragPayload { pane_id,
tile_index }` + `PaneDragPayload { pane_id }` and nothing else; its doc still names
the gpui-era `host::tearout` execution home. winit 0.30 supports N windows on one
event loop (the actors are `!Send` and UI-thread-bound, so shared state over `Rc` is
fine — no cross-thread concern).

## Architecture

Split `App` into a `Shell` (the `ApplicationHandler`) over shared state + a map of
window views:

```
struct Shell {
    shared: SharedState,                      // grouped subsystems (below)
    windows: HashMap<WindowId, WindowView>,   // one per OS window
    primary: WindowId,                        // the window that owns the orrery (until MW6)
}

struct WindowView {
    surface: WindowSurface,                   // per-window surface + config (shares one device)
    runner: GenetAppRunner<...>, dom: ...,   // this window's chrome (toolbar/omnibar)
    frame_layout: FrameLayout,
    kind: WindowKind,                         // payload enum (below)
    // per-window view + render caches: cursor, modifiers, drags, *_rects, *_textures,
    // width/height, toolbar_h, cursor_icon, maximized_pane, active_content, renaming,
    // switcher caches, shellbar_edge
}

enum WindowKind { Primary(OrreryView), Leaf, Forked(OrreryView) }  // payload = who owns a camera
```

**Event handlers emit commands; the `Shell` applies them.** `window_event` borrows
exactly one `WindowView` + the `SharedState` subsystem it needs and returns a
`Vec<ShellCommand>` (`SpawnLeaf { payload, donor }`, `ReleaseTile`, `RouteRedraw`,
`PromoteLeafToBranch`, …); the `Shell` then applies them with full `&mut self`. This is
the same record-intent-then-drain pattern the host already runs everywhere
(`drain_pending_command` / `drain_pending_context` / `drain_comms_intent`), so it is
in-idiom — and it sidesteps every multi-window aliasing question (tear-out is a
two-window op: donor releases a binding, recipient acquires it; you cannot casually
take two `&mut` from one `HashMap`). It also gives a window-system-free test seam for
tear-out logic, and makes MW5's toast escalation just another command. Decide this
before **MW2** (the method-signature split), not after — MW1's field carve commits to
no signatures, so nothing is foreclosed yet.

**`SharedState` is subdivided, not a second god-struct.** Group it into subsystems so
window code takes the narrow borrow it needs: `content` (constellation + store +
fetch), `identity` (manifests + sessions), `presentation` (theme + engine_registry),
`comms`, `inbox`. `user_event` drains the inbox once and **multicasts** results to the
affected windows from day one — chrome-relevant shared state (sync status, inbox
badges) flows from `SharedState` through the fan-out, since per-window `ScriptedDom`
means per-window chrome *state* (a v0 broadcast-redraw would otherwise become quietly
load-bearing).

**Chrome is per-window, which is leverage, not just cost.** Each `WindowKind` is a
different DOM *template*: a leaf window gets a slim chrome (no shellbar, no switcher)
with no layout code, the MW5 toast is a DOM overlay, the drag ghost is a positioned DOM
element. Genet's DOM layout makes these variations free.

The one deferred decision: **how the shared graph is held** — and it is deferred behind
a trait, not left open. Leaf rendering depends on a read-only `NodeView` seam (resolve
`member → url` + node metadata; content comes from the shared constellation). Both
options implement `NodeView`, so the choice does not leak into leaf code:

- **A — graph registry (the brief's model).** Extract `Graph` + physics out of
  `Orrery` into `SharedState` as a `GraphId`-keyed registry; `Orrery` becomes a view
  over a registry graph. Cleanest; unlocks far-B + a second orrery window. Larger
  refactor. Implements `NodeView`.
- **B — primary-orrery access.** The primary orrery's graph implements `NodeView`
  directly; leaf windows render against it. Lighter; carries MW3–MW4.

Lean **A** as the destination; **B** carries through MW4 behind the same `NodeView`
trait, so MW6 swaps the impl without chasing ad-hoc accessors.

## Phases (done-conditions, not dates)

### MW1 — carve `WindowView`

- Extract the per-window view + render-cache fields out of `App` into a `WindowView`
  struct; `App` keeps the shared state and holds one `WindowView`. Render and input
  operate on `&mut WindowView` + `&mut SharedState`. No behavior change; still one
  window.

Done when meerkat runs exactly as today with the per-window state living in a
`WindowView` the methods take explicitly.

### MW2 — the window registry + the command seam

- Rename/reshape `App` into `Shell { shared, windows: HashMap<WindowId, WindowView>,
  primary }`; `ApplicationHandler` routes each `window_event` to `windows[&id]` and
  `user_event` multicasts inbox results to the affected windows.
- Establish the command seam now (before the method signatures harden): per-window
  handlers borrow one `WindowView` + the needed `SharedState` subsystem and return
  `Vec<ShellCommand>`; the `Shell` applies them with full `&mut self`. Subdivide
  `SharedState` into its subsystems.

**Reshape entry point (found while finishing MW1):** the remaining per-window fields
do *not* yield to the mechanical bulk-move that carried MW1's 32 fields, so MW2 starts
with the structural reshape itself:

- Replace `WindowView`'s `#[derive(Default)]` with a real `WindowView::new(...)`: the
  surface (`window`, `host`), the chrome (`dom`, `runner`, `workbench` + its dom /
  runner), the frame (`frame_layout`, `next_pane_id`, `maximized_pane`,
  `active_content`), and the input bits (`cursor`, `modifiers`, `toolbar_h`, `width`,
  `height`) are not `Default`-able / are computed at construction, so they thread
  through the constructor rather than slotting into a derive.
- These also can't be bulk-rewritten (`self.host` is a substring of `self.host_text`;
  `self.toolbar_h` of `self.toolbar_height()`), so the access-site rewrite is the
  careful per-site pass that the `App`→`Shell` split does anyway.
- Order: `WindowView::new` + move structural fields → group the rest into `SharedState`
  → `Shell { shared, windows, primary }` + route by `WindowId` → `ShellCommand` seam.

**MW2 scope (2026-06-10, grounded against the post-X1 code):**

*Field destinations.* The ~30 fields still on `App` split three ways:

- **→ `WindowView` (this phase's move, with measured access sites):**
  `runner` + `dom` (89 + 7 — the bulk is mechanical `self.runner.update(...)` →
  `view.runner.update(...)`), `workbench` + `workbench_dom` + `workbench_runner`
  (26 + 4 + 6), `frame_layout` (27) + `next_pane_id` (6) + `maximized_pane` (13) +
  `active_content` (10), `cursor` (27) + `modifiers` (24) + `toolbar_h` (7) +
  `width` (18) + `height` (14), `window` (11) + `host` (5), and — resolving open
  question 3 here — `a11y_bridge` + `a11y_action_routes` (5 + routes): the
  bridge installs against one window, so it is per-window by construction.
  Roughly 360 sites total, versus MW1's ~140; the known substring traps
  (`host`/`host_text`, `toolbar_h`/`toolbar_height()`, `cursor`/`cursor_icon`)
  rule out bulk rewrite for exactly the fields with the most sites.
- **→ `SharedState` subsystems:** `content` { constellation, store,
  content map, fetch_handle, engine_registry }, `session` { manifests,
  active_session_id, session_dir, mere_root, session_thumbnails,
  session_labels, host_text }, `presentation` { theme, chrome_theme,
  chrome_sheet, active_theme_id, saved_tab_cap, shellbar_edge — the *setting*
  is shared; which windows render a shellbar is the `WindowKind` template's
  call }, `comms` { comms_handle }, `sync` { sync_handle }, `inbox`
  { KernelInbox, diagnostics_rx }, plus `observability`.
- **→ stays on `Shell`:** `orrery` (58 sites; the MW6 IOU). Moving it into
  `WindowKind::Primary`'s payload now would rewrite all 58 into
  primary-window lookups for zero pre-MW3 benefit — MW2 seats the
  `WindowKind` *marker* and MW6 moves the payload. Also `clipboard`
  (system-global, 2 sites) and `_kernel`.

*The Option dividend.* `window` and `host` are `Option` only because
`resumed()` arrives after construction. In the registry a `WindowView` is
constructed *inside* `resumed` (window create → `SurfaceHost` boot → a11y
install → insert into `windows`), so both become non-Option fields and the
`self.host.as_ref().unwrap()` scatter dies with the move.

*X1 changed one thing under this plan.* `App` now carries
`scrying: ScryingHost` (compatibility-view WebViews). Its producers are
**HWND-parented**, so the pool cannot be naively shared: the compat *pins*
are session state (→ `SharedState.content`) and the producer pool is
per-window (→ `WindowView`); the type already separates the two internally.
Consequence for MW4: a torn-out compat tile spawns a fresh WebView parented
to the new window — consistent with spawn-on-drop, no WebView migration.

*Event-loop rewiring (the three real seams in `app_handler.rs`):*

1. `resumed` — today early-returns if the window exists; becomes "create the
   primary if `windows.is_empty()`" and otherwise a no-op (winit calls it on
   every resume).
2. `window_event` — today early-returns on id mismatch (the registry's
   degenerate form); becomes `windows.get_mut(&id)` dispatch.
   `CloseRequested` forks by kind: primary saves + exits (today's behavior),
   a non-primary window just drops its view (MW3's consumer).
3. `user_event` — the multicast inventory, measured: fetch pages /
   subresources / contributions mutate **shared** state (then redraw the
   windows showing the affected members); the **sync indicator** and every
   **comms update** write *chrome state* via `runner.update`, which becomes a
   write per window whose template carries that chrome (sync chip: all;
   comms pane: the windows with it open). MW2 wraps these writes in the
   fan-out loop while N=1 so MW3 inherits a real seam, per the
   no-load-bearing-broadcast-redraw note above.

*The command-seam v0 boundary* (tempering "mutations applied as commands" so
MW2 does not balloon): pure view mutations (drags, scroll, cursor icon,
hover) stay direct on `(&mut WindowView, &mut SharedState-subsystem)` narrow
borrows — they never alias two windows. `ShellCommand` v0 covers what needs
full `&mut Shell` or a second window: `Exit { save }`, `SwitchSession(id)`
(clears constellation + scrying, reloads orrery + frame), `SetTheme(id)`
(rebuilds every window's sheet), `SpawnWindow(kind)` / `CloseWindow(id)`
(seated now, consumed by MW3/MW4), and the existing `drain_pending_command`
dispatch re-homed as command application. Handler shape:
`fn on_*(view: &mut WindowView, shared: &mut ..., ...) -> Vec<ShellCommand>`,
applied by `Shell::apply` after the borrow ends.

*Step order, each step compiling + 44/63 tests green (the MW1 discipline):*
(a) `WindowView::new` + the structural move, window/host first (kills the
Options), then chrome runners, frame cluster, input bits — methods stay on
`App`; (b) group `SharedState` subsystems (pure field moves); (c) the
receiver shift, one module at a time (render → input → frame_ops →
app_handler), converting `&mut self` methods to `(view, shared)` functions;
(d) rename `App` → `Shell`, add `windows: HashMap<WindowId, WindowView>` +
`primary`, route by id; (e) `ShellCommand` + drains through it. Touch-point
not to forget: `agent_harness` and `save_session` read fields that move
(`frame_layout` → view), so their signatures shift in (c).

**Step (a) is done (2026-06-10, commits `1afe35d` + `6397b26`).** All
per-window state lives in `WindowView` behind `App.view`, minted by
`WindowView::new`; methods still hang off `App`. The focused reshape session
resumes at **(b)** and runs (b)→(e). Remaining churn is ~285 shared-field
access sites (measured), dominated by `orrery` 58, `observability` 49,
`constellation` 33 — note `orrery` *stays on `Shell`* (the MW6 IOU), so its
58 sites become `self.orrery` → `self.shared`-less `Shell`-level access, not a
subsystem path; only the `SharedState`-bound fields take the deeper
`self.shared.<subsystem>.<field>` path. Decision made (2026-06-10, Mark): **subdivide
into subsystems in one pass, do not stage flat-first.** Flat-first rewrites
every shared site twice (`self.manifests` → `self.shared.manifests` →
`self.shared.session.manifests`) and buys nothing: staging only pays when the
grouping is uncertain, and the subsystem map (`content` / `session` /
`presentation` / `comms` / `sync` / `inbox` + `observability`) is already
decided. The compiler drives the whole pass: move one field to its final path,
chase the errors, `cargo check`, next field. A field landed in the wrong
subsystem costs one cheap follow-up rename, not a redesign. `orrery` (58) and
`_kernel` stay `Shell`-level fields (not under `shared`); `observability` (49)
sits directly at `shared.observability`, not nested deeper. The substring traps
that shaped (a) do not bite here — the shared fields (`orrery`,
`constellation`, `manifests`, ...) have no method/sibling collisions — so (b)
is closer to a clean compiler-chased pass than the carve was.

*Reshape session brief (decided 2026-06-10, Mark — the tactical layer over the
(b)→(e) order above):*

- **(b) Split `ScryingHost` as part of this step, not later.** The compat *pins*
  (`compat: HashSet<GraphMemberId>`) are session state and move to
  `shared.content`; the HWND-parented producer *pool* is per-window and stays in
  `WindowView`. The type already separates the two internally, so this is pulling
  one field up — and doing it now means MW3 does not inherit a wrong-sided pool.
- **(c) Convert bottom-up in call-graph order.** The trap of the receiver shift:
  a converted free function cannot call an unconverted `&mut self` method.
  Convert the leaves first, per module. Two leaves to do immediately because
  nearly everything calls them: `request_redraw` (becomes a `WindowView` method
  now that the window handle lives there) and `toolbar_height` (becomes
  `fn(view, shared)` — it reads the view's `dom` + size and the shared chrome
  sheet, caches into `view.toolbar_h`).
- **(c) Start signatures with the whole `&mut SharedState`, not per-subsystem
  borrows.** The subsystems exist so narrow borrows are *available*; enumerating
  them in every signature re-churns the signature each time a function needs one
  more. Take `(view: &mut WindowView, shared: &mut SharedState)` everywhere and
  narrow only where the borrow checker actually forces it. The seam holds either
  way.
- **(c) Watch the disjoint-borrow pattern in `render`.** Pre-MW1, render leaned
  on disjoint field paths through `self` (immutable `self.host` beside mutable
  `self.view.tile_textures`). With `host` now inside `WindowView`, that
  disjointness survives *only* while both stay direct field paths (`view.host`
  vs `view.tile_textures`). The moment a helper method on `&mut WindowView` is
  called while `view.host` is borrowed, it breaks. Keep render's host-borrow +
  cache-mutation as field paths, not methods.
- **(d) Build the registry before the rename; do not skip the fan-out.**
  Introduce `windows: HashMap<WindowId, WindowView>` + `primary` and route
  `window_event` by id while the struct is still `App`; rename to `Shell` as the
  final mechanical commit so each diff stays reviewable. Wrap the `user_event`
  chrome-state writes (the sync chip and all five comms arms) in the
  for-each-window loop even though N=1 — the seam is wanted from day one so MW3
  does not discover a load-bearing single-window assumption.
- **(e) Hold the v0 command boundary.** `ShellCommand` covers `Exit`,
  `SwitchSession`, `SetTheme`, `Spawn`/`CloseWindow`, and the re-homed
  `drain_pending_command` dispatch. Resist converting drags / scroll / cursor
  into commands, and resist drive-by render-internals work — the cheap-path plan
  owns that and lands after this reshape on purpose.
- **The one rule for the whole pass:** the most dangerous moment is (c)'s
  midpoint, where half the methods are converted and half are not, and the
  temptation is a temporary accessor layer to bridge them. Do not — it hides the
  seam and has to be unwound. The bottom-up order exists so the bridge is never
  needed.
- **Known signature shifts to expect** (not surprises): `save_session` reads
  `frame_layout` (now in the view) and `agent_harness` reads several moved
  fields, so both shift in (c).

Done when the single window is driven through the registry (events resolved by id,
mutations applied as commands), with the shared/​per-window seam enforced by the types
— and the `window`/`host` unwrap scatter is gone (both non-Option inside `WindowView`).

### MW3 — a second window, shared state (one device, N surfaces)

- **Split `SurfaceHost`** (in `genet-winit-host`) into a shared `RenderCore` (the one
  wgpu device + netrender `Renderer`) and a per-window `WindowSurface` (surface +
  config). Today `SurfaceHost::boot` mints its own device per call, so two windows
  would be two devices and the shared constellation texture could not be sampled into a
  second swapchain. One device + N surfaces lets a leaf **blit the donor's node
  texture** into its own backbuffer — the cheapest possible multi-window, and the
  payoff of this whole architecture.
- A "new window" command (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N) opens a second OS window over the same
  `SharedState`, with its own `WindowView` (own chrome, frame_layout, size). v0: the
  second window is **workbench-only** (`WindowKind::Leaf`), rendering shared nodes'
  tiles through the shared `constellation` behind the `NodeView` seam.
- Present must not block across windows: keep acquire non-blocking (skip-on-outdated is
  already there) so a slow window does not stall another's input on the shared loop.

Done when two windows coexist on one device, the second shows a shared node's live
tile (texture shared, not re-rendered), and closing it leaves the graph + the first
window intact.

*MW3 implementation brief (2026-06-10, grounded in the `SurfaceHost` + netrender code):*

- **Load-bearing unknown resolved — no netrender change needed.** `SurfaceHost::boot`
  calls `netrender::boot()` (mints a fresh instance/adapter/device/queue) then
  `create_netrender_instance(handles, options)`, which *moves* the handles into the
  `Renderer`. But `netrender_device::WgpuHandles` exposes `pub instance:
  wgpu::Instance` + `pub adapter: wgpu::Adapter`, reachable as
  `renderer.wgpu_device.core.{instance, adapter}`. So a second window's surface is
  `core.instance.create_surface(window)` + caps from `core.adapter` + configure with
  `core.device` — all from the one shared `Renderer`. The one-device/N-surfaces split
  is **entirely within `genet-winit-host` + `meerkat`**; the cross-repo `netrender`
  checkout is untouched.
- **The split (genet-winit-host).** `SurfaceHost { surface, surface_config, renderer }`
  becomes `RenderCore { renderer }` (shared: owns instance/adapter/device/queue +
  netrender pipelines) and `WindowSurface { surface, surface_config }` (per window).
  Method assignment: `rasterize` / `renderer` / `device` / `queue` → `RenderCore`;
  `acquire` / `resize` / `format` → `WindowSurface` (taking `&RenderCore` for the
  device); new `RenderCore::create_surface(window, w, h) -> WindowSurface`. Keep
  `boot`/`boot_async` as `RenderCore::boot`. (Other consumer to update: the orrery host,
  per the crate's Cargo description — check it before landing.)
- **The rewire (meerkat).** `Shell` gains `render_core: Option<RenderCore>` (booted once
  on the first `resumed`; shared infra, so top-level like `clipboard`, not in
  `SharedState`). `WindowView.host: Option<SurfaceHost>` becomes `surface:
  Option<WindowSurface>`. The render path (`render.rs`, all `self.view.host.*`) splits
  into `self.render_core` (rasterize/compose) + `self.view.surface` (acquire/resize) —
  but those live on different borrow sources, so the render method takes them as
  explicit params or the ctx grows a `render_core` field. Scrying `drive()` currently
  pulls `device`/`queue` from the host → now from `render_core`. **Borrow note:** the
  brief's render disjointness (`view.host` immut beside `view.tile_textures` mut) shifts
  — `render_core` is now a separate field from `view`, which actually *eases* it.
- **Step order, each green:** (1) split `SurfaceHost` in genet-winit-host, update the
  current single-window caller in lockstep (still one window, behavior-preserving);
  (2) `Shell.render_core` + `WindowView.surface`, rewire the render path + scrying
  device source; (3) the **`ShellCommand` queue + `Shell::apply` (this is deferred
  (e), now real)** with `SpawnWindow(WindowKind)` / `CloseWindow(id)` + a Cmd/Ctrl+
  Shift+N verb; (4) `WindowKind::{Primary, Leaf}` + slim leaf chrome template +
  workbench-only leaf rendering shared tiles behind a read-only `NodeView` seam; (5)
  **(d2) the `user_event` fan-out** (now testable against window 2) + present stays
  non-blocking; (6) `a11y_bridge` + routes → `WindowView` (open question 3). MW2's
  deferred (d2) + (e) land in steps 3 and 5, where a second window finally exercises them.

### MW4 — leaf tear-out gesture

- Drag a workbench tab (or a pane header) past the slop. The drag **ghost is rendered
  as chrome inside the donor surface** (a positioned DOM element); the leaf window is
  spawned **on release (drop)**, not mid-drag. This is the only portable shape: a
  live window-follows-cursor would need a mid-gesture pointer-grab transfer Wayland
  forbids, and winit's `drag_window` is a window-*move* request, not this. The spawn is
  a `SpawnLeaf` command carrying `TileDragPayload` / `PaneDragPayload`.
- The leaf window carries the donor's `GraphId`; the donor releases its binding of the
  tile. Within-tile navigation in the leaf updates the shared node (edits propagate to
  the donor) via the `NodeView` seam.
- **Re-docking** (dragging a leaf back into a window) is **out of scope for MW4** — it
  is the same cross-window-drop-detection problem, which on Wayland routes through the
  OS data-device protocol (no global cursor position to hit-test against). Scoped to a
  later phase so the gesture model is not invalidated by deciding it late.

Done when dragging a tile out drops a leaf window of it on release, edits propagate
both ways, and closing the leaf does not delete the node (brief §4.1). The closed-leaf
rule is deliberate: the node stays graph-reachable but tile-less, rather than
returning the tile to the donor (the command seam makes either trivial; this is the
chosen one).

### MW5 — branch + fork + the escalation toast

- **Branch** (Shift+drag): mint a `GraphletRef` (`GraphletBinding::Branched`) in the
  donor's forme; the leaf window carries donor `GraphId` + the new `GraphletId`.
- **Fork** (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+drag): mint a new `SessionId` + `GraphId` via
  `ManifestStore` + a cross-graph rekey of the reachable connected component; weak
  `parent_session` on the new manifest; the new window gets a thin orrery (needs MW6).
- **Toast** on an unmodified drop: `[ Branch ] [ Fork ] [ Keep as leaf ]`, auto-
  dismiss = keep as leaf (brief §3.2).

Done when all three operations run from the gesture model and the toast escalates a
leaf in place, per the brief's identity semantics.

### MW6 — the orrery split (second orrery window; meets far-B)

- Decision A: extract `Graph` + physics into a `SharedState` graph registry; `Orrery`
  becomes a per-window view (camera + input + render) over a registry graph. A
  fork/torn orrery window then runs its own camera over its own (or a shared) graph.
- This is the far-B substrate too: graph-bound leaves resolve their `graph_id` against
  the registry, so leaves of different graphs can coexist in one window.

Done when a window can host a live orrery over a registry graph independent of the
primary window's camera, and far-B leaf coexistence falls out of the same registry.

## Open questions

1. **Shared-graph holding (A vs B).** *Resolved into the architecture:* both impls sit
   behind the `NodeView` seam, so A (registry) is the destination and B (primary-orrery)
   carries MW3–MW4 with no leakage. MW6 swaps the impl. Not a fork any more.
2. **Switcher per window.** *Leaning resolved:* per-`WindowKind` chrome is a different
   DOM template, so a leaf window simply uses a slim template (no shellbar / switcher).
   A leaf is a single torn tile, not a session surface.
3. **a11y bridge per window.** Each window needs its own AccessKit adapter + projection.
   Confirm `AccessKitBridge` supports N instances; the projection is already a pure
   function of state.
4. **Re-docking a leaf.** Out of scope through MW5; it is the same cross-window-drop
   problem (Wayland routes it through the OS data-device protocol). Decide its phase
   before locking the gesture model so it is not invalidated late.
5. **Frame pacing on the shared loop.** N surfaces present serially on one thread. Keep
   acquire non-blocking; revisit only if two windows on different-refresh monitors
   actually contend (Fifo + frame-latency 2 should absorb the common case).

## Progress

- 2026-06-10: Plan written. Grounded in the live single-window `App`/​
  `ApplicationHandler` (one window, ~80-field god-struct mixing shared session state
  and per-window view state) and the [tear-out brief](../research/2026-05-11_tearout_operations_brief.md)'s
  leaf/branch/fork model. Key finding: **leaf** is workbench-only, so the first useful
  multi-window milestone (MW3–MW4) needs the shared `constellation` + a read view of
  the graph, not a second orrery — the orrery/graph split (the far-B-grade refactor) is
  deferred to MW6. Staged MW1 (carve `WindowView`) → MW2 (window registry) → MW3
  (second shared window) → MW4 (leaf tear-out) → MW5 (branch/fork/toast) → MW6 (orrery
  split, meets far-B). Supersedes the never-written `2026-06-04_multi_window_plan.md`.
- 2026-06-10: **MW1 begun — first cluster carved.** New
[window_view.rs](../../../crates/meerkat/src/window_view.rs) *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-link --> holds `WindowView`; the
  9 per-frame **hit-rect caches** (switcher rows / close / add, roster rows, apparatus
  buttons, gloss nodes, tile rects, content rects, close-button rects) moved off the
  `App` god-struct into `App.view`. These are pure view geometry (rebuilt each render,
  read by input to route a press), so they carve cleanly first. 32 access sites
  updated across render / input / frame_ops / app_handler; behavior-preserving (meerkat
  44 lib + 63 bin green). `WindowView` grows cluster by cluster next: paint-texture
  caches → interaction / drag state → frame + layout → window / surface → chrome
  runners, until `App` splits into `Shell { shared, windows }` at MW2.
- 2026-06-10: **Architecture revised after an external review** (verified against the
  code, not taken on faith). Adopted: (1) a **command seam** — per-window handlers emit
  `Vec<ShellCommand>` the `Shell` applies with full `&mut self`, matching the host's
  existing drain-intent pattern; settles every two-window-aliasing question before MW2
  hardens signatures. (2) A **`NodeView` trait** for leaf rendering, turning the A/B
  graph-holding fork into an impl detail behind a stable seam. (3) **`SharedState`
  subdivided** into subsystems (content / identity / presentation / comms / inbox);
  inbox **multicasts** so shared chrome state (sync / inbox badges) flows through
  fan-out, not a load-bearing broadcast-redraw. (4) **One wgpu device, N surfaces** —
  *verified*: `SurfaceHost::boot` mints a device per call today, so MW3 must split it
  (in `genet-winit-host`) into a shared `RenderCore` + per-window `WindowSurface`,
  which is what lets a leaf blit the donor's node texture rather than re-render it. (5)
  Tear-out is **spawn-on-drop** with an in-donor drag ghost (live window-follows-cursor
  needs a mid-gesture pointer-grab transfer Wayland forbids; winit `drag_window` is a
  move request); **re-docking** scoped out. (6) `WindowKind` is a payload enum
  (`Primary(OrreryView)` / `Leaf` / `Forked(OrreryView)`) so camera ownership is typed.
  Per-`WindowKind` chrome = a different DOM template (slim leaf chrome answers the
  switcher-per-window question). Tempered the reviewer's vsync-stall claim to a
  non-blocking-acquire note. No staging change.
- 2026-06-10: **MW1 continued — texture + interaction clusters carved (27 fields
  total).** `WindowView` now holds the 9 hit-rect caches, the 6 paint-texture caches,
  and the 12 interaction fields (scroll / drags / cursor_icon / pending_exit /
  context_set / renaming). `CachedTile` + `ResizeDrag` made `pub(crate)`. ~72 access
  sites updated; behavior-preserving (44 lib + 63 bin green). **Deliberate MW1/MW2
  boundary:** the surface / chrome / input-device fields (`window`, `host`, `runner` +
  `dom`, `workbench*`, `frame_layout`, `cursor`, `modifiers`, `toolbar_h`, size) move
  *with* MW2's registry, because that is where the method signatures shift to
  `(&mut WindowView, &mut SharedState)` + the `ShellCommand` seam — moving them now
  would only churn them twice. The remaining clean view-session fields
  (`focused_tile`, `live_previews`, `content_location`, `shown_location`,
  `active_content`, `maximized_pane`, `next_pane_id`, switcher caches, `host_text`)
  are the last MW1 cluster.
- 2026-06-10: **MW2 scoped against the post-X1 code** (the scope block under the
  MW2 phase). Headlines: ~360 access sites move (vs MW1's ~140), dominated by
  `runner` (89, mostly mechanical) and `orrery` (58 — which is the argument for
  keeping `orrery` on `Shell` as the explicit MW6 IOU rather than seating it in
  `WindowKind::Primary`'s payload now). `window`/`host` become **non-Option**
  inside `WindowView` (constructed in `resumed`), killing the unwrap scatter.
  New fact the plan predated: X1's `ScryingHost` splits across the seam —
  compat pins are shared, the HWND-parented producer pool is per-window, and a
  torn-out compat tile spawns a fresh WebView in the recipient (no migration).
  `a11y_bridge` + action routes resolve per-window (open question 3). The
  command seam is bounded for v0: view mutations stay direct narrow borrows;
  commands cover Exit / SwitchSession / SetTheme / Spawn-CloseWindow + the
  re-homed `drain_pending_command` dispatch. `user_event`'s multicast inventory
  is measured: sync-chip + comms writes are the per-window chrome-state writes
  to wrap in the fan-out loop while N=1. Step order (a)-(e) in the scope block,
  each step green under the MW1 discipline.
- 2026-06-10: **MW1 clean-carve complete — view-session cluster moved (32 fields
  total).** `WindowView` now also holds `centered`, `content_location`,
  `shown_location`, `focused_tile`, `live_previews` (what this window looks at within
  the shared graph). Careful exclusions: `content_location` is also a `Chrome` field in
  the meerkat *library* — only the bin's `App` accesses were rewritten; the switcher
  caches (`session_thumbnails` / `session_labels`) + `host_text` are **shared-derived**,
  so they stay on `App` headed for `SharedState`, not `WindowView`. The frame cluster
  (`frame_layout`, `next_pane_id`, `maximized_pane`, `active_content`) + the structural
  fields (`window`, `host`, `runner`/`dom`, `workbench*`, `cursor`, `modifiers`,
  `toolbar_h`, size) move in **MW2** with the `App`→`Shell` reshape, the `ShellCommand`
  seam, and the method-receiver shift to `(&mut WindowView, &mut SharedState)`. 36
  bin-file access sites updated; behavior-preserving (44 lib + 63 bin green).
- 2026-06-10: **MW2 carve complete — every per-window field now lives in `WindowView`.**
  Four clusters moved off `App` into `App.view` across this and the prior session: the
  **frame** cluster (`frame_layout`, `next_pane_id`, `maximized_pane`, `active_content`;
  unblocked by a hand-written `Default for FrameLayout` + a `Default` `ContentPane`), the
  **scrying** cluster (`scrying`/`ScryingHost`, `scrying_rect`, `scrying_input_focus`,
  per-window because each WebView is HWND-bound, folding in the X1/X2 work), the
  **window/size/input** cluster (`window`, `host`, `toolbar_h`, `width`, `height`,
  `cursor`, `modifiers`), and the **chrome-runner** cluster (`dom`, `runner`, `workbench`,
  `workbench_dom`, `workbench_runner`). The runners are `!Default` (a genet document
  authority can't be conjured), so this **ends the derive-`Default` era**: `WindowView`
  now has an explicit [`WindowView::new(dom, runner, workbench, workbench_dom,
workbench_runner)`](../../../crates/meerkat/src/window_view.rs) *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-link --> over a fresh runner pair,
  which is exactly how a second window will be minted over the same shared session.
  Collision-aware edits throughout: `self.host`/`self.host_text`,
  `self.toolbar_h`/`self.toolbar_height()`, `self.window`/`self.window_control()`, and
  `self.workbench`/`self.workbench_open()` all share a literal prefix, so those went
  per-site or by trailing-char form, never bulk. ~140 access sites updated; behavior-
  preserving (44 lib + 63 bin green). **`App` is now cleanly bisected:** `view:
  WindowView` is all per-window state; the remaining ~25 fields (orrery, the actor
  handles, constellation, the session registry + switcher caches, theming, observability,
  a11y, settings, inbox) are the shared set headed for `SharedState`. The reshape
  (group `SharedState`, then `Shell { shared, windows: HashMap<WindowId, WindowView>,
  primary }` + route by `WindowId` + the `ShellCommand` seam) is the only MW2 work left.
- 2026-06-10: **MW2 (b) done — `SharedState` grouped + `ScryingHost` split** (commits
  `979176f` + `a989988`). (b1): the ~25 shared fields lifted off `App` into a
  `SharedState` subdivided into subsystems — `content` { constellation, pages, store,
  fetch_handle, engine_registry }, `session` { manifests, active_session_id, session_dir,
  mere_root, switcher caches, host_text }, `presentation` { theme, chrome_theme,
  chrome_sheet, active_theme_id, saved_tab_cap, shellbar_edge }, and flat `comms_handle` /
  `sync_handle` / `observability` + `inbox` (now carrying the diagnostics receiver). `App`
  keeps `orrery` (the MW6 IOU), the per-window `view`, `clipboard` (system-global), the
  a11y bridge + routes (per-window, deferred), and the kernel marker. Subdivide-in-one-pass
  as decided (no flat-first); ~192 `self.X` + the `app.X` test sites rewritten compiler-
  chased via word-boundary regex (the only collisions were the already-moved
  `content_location` and the foreign `ResourceStore::store`, both dodged by `\b` / file
  scope). (b2): `ScryingHost` split — the compat *pins* (a `HashSet`) became session state
  at `shared.content.compat_pins`; the HWND-parented producer *pool* stays per-window on
  `WindowView.scrying`. Only 3 sites touched compat (`is_compat` read, `clear`,
  `toggle_compat`); `toggle_focus_compat` now toggles the shared pin then reaps the local
  tile inline (genuinely cross-cutting). Both steps behavior-preserving (44 lib + 63 bin
  green). **Remaining: (c) the receiver shift** — convert `&mut self` methods to
  `(view, shared)` functions bottom-up so the registry can target a specific window;
  then (d) `windows` HashMap + `WindowId` routing + `App`→`Shell`, (e) the `ShellCommand`
  seam. (c) is the bulk of the remaining work and its midpoint is the reshape's most
  delicate moment (half-converted methods, no bridge allowed), so it wants a focused run.
- 2026-06-10: **MW2 (c) done — receiver shift via a `WindowCtx` borrow-bundle, not free
  functions.** Decision (with Mark, after weighing free-fns vs a context bundle): the
  bulk event-handling logic moves from `impl App` to `impl WindowCtx<'a>`, a borrow
  bundle `{ view, shared, orrery, clipboard, a11y_bridge, a11y_action_routes }`. Rationale:
  the granular per-function type-seam free-fns would give is mostly *illusory here* —
  almost every heavy handler touches view+shared+orrery together, the shell is
  single-threaded by construction (`!Send` kernel), cross-window ops go through
  `ShellCommand` regardless, and orrery folds into the view at MW6 — so the bundle's
  near-zero body churn + preserved cross-module `self.foo()` win. Bodies are unchanged
  (`self.view`/`self.shared`/`self.orrery` resolve to ctx fields), so it is a receiver
  rename, not a logic rewrite. The winit trait impl, `App::new`, and the agent harness
  stay on `App` and route through `let mut wc = self.ctx()` (two-phase borrows handle
  `wc.m(wc.view.x)`). Genuinely narrow leaves went to their natural owner first
  (`request_redraw` on `WindowView`, `chrome_sheet_refs` on `Presentation`). One pitfall
  hit and fixed: the codebase uses local `cx`/`cy` for cursor coords, so the ctx var is
  `wc`, not `cx`. Behavior-preserving (44 lib + 63 bin green).
- 2026-06-10: **MW2 (d1) done — the window registry routes by `WindowId`.** `App.view`
  becomes `windows: HashMap<WindowId, WindowView>` + `primary: Option<WindowId>`. winit
  splits construction (`new`) from window creation (`resumed`), so the primary view is
  built in `new()` and stashed in `pending_view`; `resumed` creates the OS window, fills
  the view, inserts under `window.id()`, sets `primary`, then drives the initial a11y
  install + switcher/a11y refresh + restored content through the ctx. `window_event`
  resolves the event's id via `window_ctx(id)` (the lookup *is* the routing; unknown ids
  dropped). `ctx()` falls back to `pending_view` before `resumed` so the headless agent
  harness still works; a read-only `view()` accessor covers `&App` read paths; a
  `primary.is_none()` guard in `user_event` rides out pre-resume actor wakes (the typed
  channels buffer). Behavior-preserving at N=1 (44 lib + 63 bin green). **Registry shape
  chosen (with Mark): uniform map + `pending_view` staging**, not a primary-field +
  secondaries-map, to avoid the asymmetry/soup. **Remaining to close MW2:** (d2) the
  `user_event` chrome-write fan-out (a `for` over windows; no-op at N=1, MW3 seam),
  (d3) the `App`→`Shell` rename (cosmetic; a safe global `\bApp\b` sweep — verified it
  can't hit `GenetAppRunner`/`ApplicationHandler`), and (e) the `ShellCommand` seam.
  **Carried forward (documented in the struct comments):** `a11y_bridge` + routes →
  `WindowView` at MW3; `orrery` → `WindowKind::Primary` at MW6.
- 2026-06-10: **MW2 structural reshape complete — (d3) done, (d2) + (e) consciously
  rolled into MW3.** (d3): `App`→`Shell` rename landed (global `\bApp\b`→`Shell`, 30
  sites; `Shell` was free, no `Shellbar*` collision). The god-struct is now `Shell
  { shared, windows, primary, pending_view, orrery, clipboard, a11y_*, _kernel }`.
  **(d2) the `user_event` chrome-write fan-out and (e) the `ShellCommand` seam are
  deferred to MW3, by decision, not omission** — and the reasoning is the same for
  both: every bit of their *real* payload is N>1-coupled. (d2)'s sync-chip + comms
  writes correctly target the primary at N=1; the fan-out is a two-phase restructure
  of the actor-drain hot path that wants a second window to test against (in-code
  marker placed). (e)'s `ShellCommand` exists to let a handler do what a single-view
  `WindowCtx` can't — `SpawnWindow`/`CloseWindow` (mutate `windows` while a view is
  borrowed) and theme/session **fan-out** across windows — but `Spawn`/`Close` have no
  trigger until MW3/MW4, the fan-out is d2's problem again, and `Exit` already works at
  the trait level while `SetTheme`/`SwitchSession`/`drain_pending_command` work as
  `WindowCtx` methods at N=1. A scaffold built now would be an `apply()` never called
  with a real cross-window command and dead enum variants — placebo. So MW3 grows the
  seam where it's first exercised (the "new window" verb + a second window's chrome).
  **What MW2 *did* deliver and is green:** SharedState subsystems, the per-window/shared
  type-seam via `WindowCtx`, and the `WindowId` registry routing events by id — the
  structural reshape that unblocks MW3. The `WindowKind` payload enum, the spawn path,
  the `ShellCommand` queue, and (d2) all land together in MW3, where they're real.
- 2026-06-10: **MW3 steps 1–2 done — one device, N surfaces (the rendering
  foundation).** Step 1 (`genet-winit-host`): `SurfaceHost` split into `RenderCore`
  (the one wgpu device + netrender `Renderer` — instance/adapter/device/queue) and
  `WindowSurface` (per-window swapchain + config, created via
  `RenderCore::create_surface` from the core's *retained* wgpu instance — confirmed
  `netrender_device::WgpuHandles` exposes `pub instance` + `pub adapter`, so **no
  netrender change**). `SurfaceHost` kept as a real single-window `RenderCore` + one
  `WindowSurface` wrapper for the standalone orrery host, so step 1 landed with zero
  consumer churn. Step 2 (meerkat): `Shell.render_core: Option<RenderCore>` (booted
  once on first `resumed`, shared like `clipboard`); `WindowView.host` → `surface:
  Option<WindowSurface>`; `WindowCtx` gains `render_core: Option<&RenderCore>`. The
  render path splits `self.view.host.*` into `self.render_core` (rasterize / renderer /
  compose) + `self.view.surface` (acquire / format); scrying pulls device/queue from
  the shared core. ~30 `host.*` sites rewired; behavior-preserving at N=1 (44 lib + 63
  bin green; genet-winit-host + orrery green through the wrapper). **Next: step 3** —
  the `ShellCommand` queue + `Shell::apply` + `SpawnWindow`/`CloseWindow` + a
  Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N verb: the first *actual* second window, where the deferred (e) seam
  becomes real (and step 4's `WindowKind::Leaf` gives that window its slim chrome).
- 2026-06-10: **MW3 step 3 done — the `ShellCommand` seam + the first real second
  window (the deferred MW2 (e), now real).** `ShellCommand { SpawnWindow,
  CloseWindow(WindowId) }` + a `Shell.commands` queue, exposed to `WindowCtx` as
  `&mut commands`: a per-window handler reaches exactly one view, so work that needs the
  event loop (create a window) or the registry (mutate `windows`) can't run there — it
  queues, and `Shell::apply` drains in **`about_to_wait`** (always fires, no
  early-return fragility, decoupled from which handler queued). **Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N**
  (`on_key_pressed`, checked before the unshifted Ctrl+N new-session verb so the shift
  distinguishes them) queues a `SpawnWindow`. Window creation factored out of `resumed`
  into `Shell::create_window` — the boot-core-once stays in `resumed`, the
  window+surface+registry-insert is shared — so the primary and a secondary are minted
  the *same* way (the seam that makes a second window cheap). `build_window_view` mints
  a fresh chrome + workbench runner pair + a default single-orrery frame over the shared
  session. **Close forks by role** (`request_close`): the primary's CloseRequested /
  custom close control saves the session + exits the app; a secondary just drops its
  view (`close_window`), leaving the graph + the other windows intact (so closing the
  2nd window no longer kills the app). The secondary is **full-chrome v0** (step 4 makes
  it a slim `WindowKind::Leaf`), has **no own a11y bridge** yet (the bridge is still
  shell-singular against the primary — step 6), and does **not live-update from actor
  wakes** yet (step 5's d2 fan-out redraws only the primary). Headless tests cover the
  verb→queue seam (Ctrl+Shift+N queues `SpawnWindow` and does *not* mint a session;
  unshifted Ctrl+N still mints a session). 44 lib + **65** bin green (+2). **[gate]
  on-screen verify (Windows laptop): Ctrl+Shift+N opens a 2nd window showing the shared
  graph; closing it leaves the 1st intact; the app exits only when the primary closes.**
  **Next: step 4** — `WindowKind::{Primary, Leaf}` + a slim leaf chrome template +
  workbench-only leaf rendering shared tiles behind the read-only `NodeView` seam.
- 2026-06-10: **MW3 step 3 gate satisfied on-screen (Windows laptop), + one boot
  bug fixed, + one pre-existing bug found.** Verified live: Ctrl+Shift+N opens a real
  independent second OS window on the shared graph; closing the second leaves the
  first running; closing the primary saves + exits the whole app (clean exit 0).
  **Boot fix:** the first launch panicked in `accesskit_windows` 0.32.1 — "the
  subclassing adapter must be created before the window is shown." The old `resumed`
  (and my `create_window` that inherited its order) called `set_visible(true)` *before*
  installing the a11y bridge. Fixed: `create_window` leaves the window hidden; the
  primary shows it *after* `a11y_bridge.install`, a secondary shows it immediately (no
  bridge yet, step 6). Latent until on-screen run (the dep assertion tightened); now
  correct. **Two observations confirming documented boundaries:** (1) interacting in
  either window converges both on one viewpoint — the **shared camera** (orrery still
  single on `Shell`, the MW6 IOU); (2) the secondary's sync chip reads "p2p off" while
  the primary reads "tessera: idle" — the **d2 deferral** (secondary doesn't get
  actor-driven chrome updates until step 5). Both expected. **Pre-existing bug surfaced
  (not a MW regression), logged for a focused follow-up:** the orrery input path passes
  the cursor as `(x, y - toolbar_height)` — it subtracts the toolbar but never the
  shellbar's X carve, and `content_band()` (frame_ops) returns `[0, th, w, h]` while
  render uses `band_after_shellbar()` (`[SHELLBAR_THICKNESS, th, w, h]` for a left
  shellbar). So with the shellbar left-docked (the default) every orrery click + hover
  lands ~one shellbar-width (~48px) to the right; the same input/render band mismatch
  drifts the roster/workbench/etc hit-rects. Fix is to unify the input-side band with
  render's `band_after_shellbar` and subtract the full orrery-pane origin (not just the
  toolbar) — wiring the currently-dead `orrery_leaf_rect` helper. Separate from MW3.
- 2026-06-11: **Cursor-offset bug fixed + verified on-screen.** `content_band()` now
  returns render's `band_after_shellbar` (so the input pane leaves, dividers, and a11y
  bounds match what's drawn), and a new `orrery_point(x, y)` maps a window point into
  the orrery pane's local space by subtracting the `orrery_leaf_rect` origin (not just
  the toolbar inset), wired into the orrery's `pointer_down` / `pointer_up` /
  `cursor_moved` calls. Hover + click now land true on nodes under a left-docked
  shellbar (Mark confirmed). Wires the formerly-dead `orrery_leaf_rect`. 44 lib + 65
  bin green.
- 2026-06-11: **MW3 step 4 part 1 — `WindowKind` + slim leaf chrome.** Seated the
  per-window `WindowKind { Primary, Leaf }` marker on `WindowView` (fixed at
  construction; `WindowView::new` takes it). A Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N spawn is now a
  **Leaf** with **slim chrome**: `Chrome` gained a `slim` flag, `chrome_view` omits
  the shellbar strip when set, `build_window_view` sets it; render + input agree that
  a slim window carves no shellbar (render's band and `content_band` both return the
  whole below-toolbar area) and the host-drawn session switcher is skipped (the
  shellbar geometry write already no-ops via its `first_with_class` guard). Headless
  test added (a leaf is slim, the primary is full). 44 lib + 66 bin green. **Part 2
  (deferred, design-laden + wants on-screen verify):** swap a leaf's content from the
  shared orrery to **workbench-only** rendering behind a read-only `NodeView` seam
  (resolve member → url + metadata from the shared constellation). A leaf today still
  shows the shared orrery under its slim chrome.
