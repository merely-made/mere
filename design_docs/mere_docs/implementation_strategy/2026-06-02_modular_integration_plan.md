# Mere Modular Integration Plan

*Written before the 2026-09-05 retirement of graphlet (TERMINOLOGY.md): read graphlet as subgraph. Identifiers such as GraphletId, GraphletRef, and SessionGraphlets are now SubgraphId, SubgraphRef, and SessionSubgraphs, and the graphlets crate is crates/graph/subgraph (code renamed 2026-09-12).*

**Date**: 2026-06-02
**Status**: Historical browser/Meerkat integration plan; superseded as Mere-wide
architecture by the [Platform Boundary and Repository Topology Plan](2026-09-02_platform_boundary_and_repository_topology_plan.md).
The unifying sequence + architecture spine for integrating the browser product
onto the single genet-as-host shell (`meerkat`). It does not replace the
canonical docs it weaves: the [composition spine](../technical_architecture/2026-05-21_mere_composition_spine.md)
(the model), the [genet-as-host flip plan](../../archive_docs/2026-06-10_completed_plans/2026-06-01_genet_host_flip_plan.md)
(the host migration), and the [adoption roadmap](../../archive_docs/2026-06-09_completed_plans/2026-05-27_adoption_roadmap.md)
(the R0–R5 wiring order). It sequences those three in-flight tracks into one build,
fixes the architecture's root question, inventories the (large) already-built
leverage surface, and schedules the cleanup.
**Grounded in**: a whole-corpus read this session (7 tracks over ~50 design docs +
crate verification against the 2026-06-02 tree). Where a doc disagrees with the
code, the code wins and the doc is flagged for reconciliation (§7).

> **Historical scope (2026-09-05).** This plan records the browser/Meerkat
> integration decision and its receipts. Its graph-rooted model remains a valid
> product-specific choice for that browser slice, but it is not the architecture
> of all Mere. The current semantic boundary gives Mere multiple owned lanes:

## 1. The architecture: a graph-rooted projection model

One principle governs the whole shell, and it is the same one rejected in the
servoshell, graphshell, and meerkat eras whenever it tried to re-invert:

> **The graph is the sole root. Everything visible is a contingent projection of
> it. No projection may become the application root.**

- **The graph (session) is the root truth** — nodes, edges, fields. The durable
  thing a window attaches to (the [multiplexer model](../research/2026-05-11_browser_multiplexer_framing.md):
  window = attach client, graph = session).
- **The orrery is the graph's own spatial presentation.** It is the legitimate
  root *surface* because it renders the graph itself, not a projection of a subset.
- **A tile is a projection of a node** — the node's media, which resides in or is
  linked from it. It carries its binding (`graph_id`) so it knows what it projects.
- **The workbench, gloss, apparatus, system views, and tiles are all contingent.**
  The workbench is a cross-graph tiled-media-analysis *mode*; gloss is a
  content-commentary strip; apparatus is a system-inspector strip. Each hangs off
  the graph. Promoting any of them to root would invert the node→projection
  relationship — the inversion we keep rejecting. **No workbench (or gloss, or
  apparatus) as root.**
- **Tear-out is a leaf falling off the tree, not a new tree.** A detached tile
  keeps its `graph_id` binding; it does not become a new root graph. The leaf
  metadata exists for exactly this.
- **Panes are window-specific and mixable**, each bound to a graph via `graph_id`,
  so one window can hold panes across multiple graphs — but mixing happens at the
  window/pane layer, never by promoting a tiled view to root.

### The layered stack

Everything below the host is host-neutral. The host is the only genet-coupled
layer. The [composition spine](../technical_architecture/2026-05-21_mere_composition_spine.md)
(graph → forme → platen → verso → inker → host) is fixed; the flip changed only
the bottom realization substrate.

| Layer | Crates | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Truth / data | `kernel` (graph + Field/Coupling), `eidetic`, `persona/identity`, `murm`/`moot`, `intel/embed`, `import`, `node-lineage` | graph + durable memory + identity + comms |
| Graph substrate | `aether` (fields), `gyre` (physics), `cartography` (projection), `arrangements`, `platen::scene_paint`/`orrery` | the graph realized as spatial geometry + paint |
| Engines | `inker` (controller), `nematic` (smolweb), `genet` (fullweb), `scrying-engine` (system WebView), `document-canvas` | node media → render output |
| Composition | `forme` (arrangement authority), `platen` (projection compiler), `verso` (surface lifecycle), `frame` (tiled-mode pane tree) | arranging projections of the graph |
| Shell domain | `chrome`, `shell-state`, `session-runtime`, `ux-events`, `register-viewer` | host-neutral view-models + routing |
| **Host (genet-coupled)** | `meerkat` (+ `genet-winit-host`), retiring: `mere-app` | window + present + input; renders the projections |

---

## 2. The host model (meerkat)

meerkat is the one app shell. The render path is settled and the seam is **not** a
renderer-registry trait (that was killed in the [2026-05-21 rescaffold](../../archive_docs/2026-06-09_pivot_superseded/2026-05-21_app_architecture_rescaffold.md);
the README's `host-ports/` + `register-renderer/` directories are gone from disk,
only an empty `register-renderer-types` stub survives). The seam is:

- **Two-root composition** (live in meerkat): a chrome-root (xilem-serval view tree
  over the reused `chrome` view-models, diffed into a `ScriptedDom`) composited
  over a **content-root**, via `netrender::compose_external_texture`. Separate-roots
  discipline from commit one.
- **The content-root is the orrery** — the active graph rendered spatially,
  full-bleed, chrome floating over it. (Today it is synthesized HTML; that is the
  central gap, §4.)
- **`content_for(graph / node / pane)` resolves to one of three composition modes**
  (the surviving, re-derived-against-genet form of the old NodeRenderer modes), as
  a **convention**, not a trait registry:
  - **in-scene** — a genet `ScriptedDom` content-root / `platen` PaintList (the
    orrery underlay, document tiles via `document-canvas`, fullweb via genet);
  - **embedded-frame** — a `netrender` `ExternalTexturePlacement` (scrying/web
    tiles, the path meerkat already exercises);
  - **overlay** — an OS WebView (wry), reserved.
- **`frame::FrameLayout` is the tiled-workbench mode container, not the window
  root.** Binary splits are BSP-complete and correct *for the tiled mode*; n-way
  grouping is tabs/stacks at the tile-group layer (`platen::PlanSlot::Tabs`,
  `forme::Arrangement::stacked`), not splits. The orrery is not a `FrameLayout`
  leaf; it is the content-root's spatial surface. *(2026-06-10: superseded by
  the shipped multi-graph work — `frame` now has a `PaneContent::Orrery` leaf
  variant and `follows_active_graph()` treats the orrery as a graph-bound pane
  leaf (MG5). The window-root half of the rule stands.)*
- **One bin; dev isolation by launch flag + headless lib tests** — `meerkat
  --graph <…> --mode orrery|workbench`, `--engine <…>`, etc. No per-domain app-host
  bin (the standalone `orrery-host` bin folds in and retires). Each lane stays a
  host-neutral lib with headless tests; the bin is the only window.

---

## 3. Already built — the leverage surface

The single biggest finding of the corpus read: **most of the parts exist, are
green, and are host-neutral. The work is wiring, not building.** Status verified
against the tree.

**Host / present (genet-as-host, live):**
- `meerkat` — chrome-as-DOM shell on screen: toolbar/omnibar/command-palette/linear
  history via xilem-serval over reused `chrome`; two-root composition. Content-root
  is now the `Orrery` (S1, `8786484`); fetch + a live engine behind it is the S2 gap.
- `genet-winit-host` — shared wgpu+netrender present stack (boot, rasterize,
  acquire, input mapping). Used by both genet bins. *(2026-06-10: only mere's
  copy exists now; no `SurfaceHost` remains anywhere in the genet repo.)*
- `orrery-host` — the full interactive orrery (platen underlay + live gyre + abs-pos
  DOM node children under one camera + pan/zoom/inertia/drag/pick/marquee/edge-pick +
  pre-materialized pool), now factored into a reusable window-agnostic `Orrery` lib
  (`frame -> (Scene, needs_redraw)` + semantic input) that meerkat hosts as its
  content-root (S1.1 `64ebe44`); the bin is a thin shell over it.

**Render substrate (frozen, build on it):** `netrender` (Scene, `composite_paint_layers`,
external-texture, box-shadow masks), `paint_list_render` (`PaintCmd`→Scene;
`DrawStroke`/`DrawPath`→`SceneShape` landed), `genet-layout` (`IncrementalLayout` +
persistent Stylist + incremental inline-transform restyle), `pelt-live`
(`scene_from_scripted_dom`/`hit_test_node` — meerkat reuses), `xilem-serval`. Render
gaps are localized warn-skips (nine-patch borders, inset shadows, path clips, stroke
cap/join/dash, advanced blend) — none block the common pane.

**Graph substrate:** `kernel` (Field/Coupling now first-class primitives; open
Semantic predicate), `aether` (field algebra + Rhai + Burn, landed), `gyre`
(rapier physics + `edge_hit_test`/`rect_select`/`cull_aabb`/`pin`), `cartography`
(projection contract), `platen` (`orrery_paint_list`/`_from_positions`/`_demoted` +
`scene_paint` + `tree_projection` + morphorm layout).

**Engines / content:** `inker` (routing + EngineDocument + Engine/SurfaceEngine
traits), `nematic` (16 smolweb engines), `document-canvas` (`InkerPaintList`, real
text via parley), `scrying-engine` (host-neutral). The pipeline is proven
end-to-end in libs: bytes → `inker` route → `EngineDocument` →
`platen::build_document_scene` → `document_canvas` → `InkerPaintList` →
`paint_list_render` → `netrender::Scene`.

**Composition:** `forme` (arrangement authority; graphlet/lens/pressure parked),
`frame` (`FrameLayout` + `PaneContent`), `verso-core`/`tile-state` (latent, reshaped
to `TileId`).

**Data (built, unwired):** `eidetic` (4-layer blob→manifest→engram→models stack +
fjall + https/iroh fetchers; only consumer is intel/embed), `session-runtime`
(manifest / view-intent / thumbnail / service-runner, all v0a primitives, not
host-wired), `intel/embed` (Tier-2 embeddings, persists through eidetic),
`linked-data` (JSON-LD bridge), `import` (ingest, no consumers).

**P2P / social (bilateral lane far along, federation barely started):** `transport`
(`P2pandaTransport` live), `murmuring` (real p2panda operations), `murm`
(`SyncedCabal`, gossip + LogSync, real SyncStatus/resync), `persona/identity`
(BLAKE3 vault + passphrase backend; OS-keychain backend unbuilt), `misfin`/`webfinger`
(built), `moothold` (stub + tessera Phase 1), `mooting` (stub).

**Net:** `netfetcher` (sibling repo; WHATWG-Fetch engine, increments 1–5, 52 tests,
**zero consumers**), `net-media` (plan-only, no crate).

---

## 4. The integration gaps (the actual work)

1. **meerkat content-root** — ~~synthesized HTML, not the orrery~~ **the orrery now
   (S1)**. Remaining: no fetch and no live engine behind a node yet. The content
   pipeline exists; meerkat does not yet consume it. This is the S2 keystone gap.
2. **Two genet bins (meerkat + orrery-host) should be one shell** — *functionally
   folded* (S1.2): both run the same `Orrery` over the shared `genet-winit-host`.
   Remaining: the orrery-host bin's physical retirement, deferred to the S7 cutover.
3. **Node-media tiles** — *shipped* (S2.2): the focused node's media renders as a
   floating card from real fetched content — document lane (nematic) + HTML lane
   (genet). Remaining: web-via-scrying (S6), binary media, multiple / at-node tiles
   and the tiled workbench (S4).
4. **netfetcher** — *consumed* (S2.2b): meerkat fetches off the UI thread (tokio
   worker + `EventLoopProxy` wake) and routes the bytes to engines. Remaining: a
   durable cookie jar / cache (host-backed `FetchContext`), binary content, and a
   real `FetchContext` policy instead of `permissive()`.
5. **Persistence** — *graph + full view-intent wired* (S3.1 / S3.2a / S3.2b):
   `session_graph_store` persists the graph and `view_intent_store` the camera +
   focused node; meerkat restores all three on launch (a reload re-opens where you
   were, card and all). Remaining: per-persona/session/manifest threading and the
   eidetic content store for media + history (S3.2c).
6. **No tiled-workbench mode / peripheral panes** — `FrameLayout` exists but meerkat
   has a single content pane; gloss/apparatus are latent a11y projections.
7. **murm/moot unsurfaced** — `SyncedCabal` works but no comms surface exists.
8. **graph-canvas deleted (2026-06-05)** — the IR cluster (`{camera, packet, projection,
   scene, scripting}`) extracted into the new `canvas-ir` crate; `graph-layout` + `platen`
   re-pointed; stale deps dropped from `cartography`/`document-canvas`/`embed`; behavioral
   modules deleted (zero live consumers); workspace rewired. Builds + tests green.
   *(2026-06-10: superseded — `canvas-ir` and `graph-layout` were themselves
   deleted 2026-06-07; keep-worthy layouts recaptured into
    `crates/orrery/arrangements` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->. See topology §8.)*
9. **register-\* latent + dual routing** — `register-viewer` (mime→viewer) duplicates
   `inker::routing` (engine-id); reconcile.
10. **Pervasive doc staleness** — README lists cut crates; many docs predate the
    June tree.

---

## 5. The build: lanes + near-term sequence

Each **lane** is a host-neutral lib (or libs) with headless tests, developable
independently and exercised in isolation via a meerkat launch flag. The lanes:
**Host/Chrome**, **Orrery/Spatial**, **Engines/Content**, **Composition/Workbench**,
**Persistence/Session**, **Field-system**, **P2P/Social**, **Intel**. The near-term
critical path threads the flip plan (P1–P5) and the adoption roadmap (R0–R5):

- **S1 — Orrery as meerkat's content-root (flip P1 → in the real shell).** Fold
  orrery-host's loop into meerkat as the content-root spatial surface (the graph,
  rendered), chrome composited over it. *Leverage*: orrery-host is done;
  `genet-winit-host` is shared. *Done*: meerkat opens to an interactive orrery of a
  graph, pan/zoom/drag/pick working, chrome on top. **Done `2026-06-02`** (S1.1
  `64ebe44` + S1.2 `8786484`); the orrery-host bin's physical retirement folds into
  the S7 cutover (it stays a lib test-harness over the shared `Orrery` until then).
- **S2 — Node media as tiles + fetch (flip P4 in-scene part + netfetcher).** Wire the
  engine pipeline so a node's content renders as a tile (in-scene): omnibar URL →
  `netfetcher::fetch` → `inker` route → engine → `document-canvas`/genet →
  `PaintList` → composited tile, bound to the node (`graph_id`). *Leverage*: the
  whole pipeline + netfetcher exist. *Done*: navigating populates the graph and shows
  a node's media as a tile. This is the graph-rooted browse loop.
  - *S2.1* (`df50602`): `Orrery::visit(url)` grows the session graph on navigation
    (URL identity dedups; new nodes link from the current selection as a browse
    trail); meerkat seeds the root and visits on every navigation.
  - *S2.2a* (`415bd88`): the focused node's media renders as a **floating card** over
    the orrery (Mark's placement pick), via the proven synchronous document pipeline
    (`EngineDocument → layout_document → scene_from_packet → composite`). Content is
    synthesized (welcome page / address placeholder) — only the byte source is a stub.
  - *S2.2b-i* (`1d9d9c0`): real `netfetcher::fetch` off the UI thread — a tokio
    worker + an `mpsc` channel + an `EventLoopProxy<()>` wake (delivery model 2),
    drained in `user_event`; per-URL content cache (Loading / Ready / Failed) with
    real loading + error card states. Renders fetched bytes as plain text.
  - *S2.2b-ii* (`7c03a93`): content-type routing — a nematic `EngineRegistry`
    (markdown / gemtext / plain / feeds) through the document lane, and `text/html`
    through the **genet lane** (`set_inner_html` → `scene_from_scripted_dom`,
    reusing the host renderer). This consumes netfetcher first (gap #4) and is the
    async-host architecture S3/S5 reuse. **S2 done `2026-06-02`.**
- **S3 — Persistence host seam (R-data).** meerkat constructs a per-identity `eidetic`
  Store + a `ManifestStore`, `load_from_disk` on startup, `mark_dirty`→debounced
  flush. Build `session_graph_store` (the eidetic↔`kernel::graph` glue; serde
  `graph.json` as the live store). *Done*: a graph survives restart; view-intent
  persists per pane.
  - *S3.1* (`900253e`): `session-runtime::session_graph_store` saves / loads the
    graph through its serde `GraphSnapshot` as `graph.json` (native-only); meerkat
    restores `<data_dir>/mere/graph.json` on launch (`Orrery::with_graph`, positions
    preserved, no re-settle) and saves after each navigation. Load failure falls
    back to a fresh session. **The graph survives restart.**
  - *S3.2a* (`8de3946`): the **camera persists** via `view_intent_store`. The orrery
    exposes `CameraView` (pan + zoom); meerkat treats `<data_dir>/mere` as the
    session dir (`graph.json` + `views/` siblings), maps the camera to/from the
    `CameraSnapshot` affine, restores it on launch (suppressing the recenter), and
    saves graph + camera after each navigation and on close. **View-intent (camera)
    persists.**
  - *S3.2b* (`fe5fdd3`): the **focused node persists**. `ViewIntent` gained a `focus`
    field (the node's URL); `Orrery::select_by_url` re-selects an existing node
    without adding one; meerkat saves the focused URL with the camera and re-selects
    it on launch. **View-intent persistence is complete: graph + camera + focus all
    survive restart, so a reload re-opens the card you had open.**
  - *S3.2c* (remaining): persona / session / manifest threading (the `ManifestStore`
    and per-id `sessions/<id>` layout already exist) for multi-session / multi-window;
    the eidetic content store for fetched media + history (debounced `mark_dirty`
    flush), so pages survive restart without re-fetching.
- **S4 — Tiled-workbench mode + peripheral panes (flip P2 + verso, R2).** `FrameLayout`
  becomes the cross-graph tiled-analysis mode over node-tiles; retarget
  `platen::layout` Morphorm→taffy under genet; light up gloss/apparatus projections;
  verso surface lifecycle gains its first real consumer here (consumer-first). *Done*:
  a workbench mode arranges node-tiles from one or more graphs; tear-out keeps
  `graph_id`.
- **S5 — Comms surface + cheap p2p win (R5 start).** Surface `murm`'s `SyncedCabal` as
  a comms view; wire `eidetic-iroh-fetcher` + transport blobs as cheesecloth-pinning
  v0 (replicate engrams by hash). Build the host OS-keychain `IdentityStorage`.
  *Done*: a working bilateral comms surface; engrams replicate by hash.
  **Detailed elaboration: [host p2p wiring plan](2026-06-03_host_p2p_wiring_plan.md)**
  (the meerkat-side wiring of transport + `SyncedCabal` + tessera `SyncedMoot`,
  sliced S5.0 foundation → S5.1 bootstrap → S5.2 persistence → S5.3 the comms
  surface). Note §3 / gap #7 are stale: tessera is now far past "Phase 1" (a
  productized `TesseraStore` + `SyncedMoot`, 60 tests), so both lanes are
  host-ready over one transport's `sync_parts`.
- **S6 — External content re-home (flip P4 embedded-frame).** Re-land scrying web
  tiles on meerkat via `ExternalTexturePlacement` (discard the dead Masonry fork
  edits; the scrying-engine crate is host-neutral). *Done*: a web/scrying tile
  composites through genet.
  **Detailed elaboration: [scrying tile plan](2026-06-10_scrying_tile_plan.md)**
  (UI-thread `ScryingHost` beside the constellation; X1 Windows-first →
  X2 input/nav → X3 lifecycle + per-node pin → X4 macOS/Linux).
- **S7 — Cutover + cleanup (flip P5 + R4).** Retire `crates/mere/app` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> and the
  xilem/masonry fork deps once meerkat reaches parity; then §7 cleanup.
- **Later (own milestones):** federation proper (moot machinery), intel workers via
  the SessionServiceRunner, profiles/advanced tear-out (branch/fork), the field-system
  intelligence payoff (Burn embedding → vector field). These ride their own lanes and
  do not gate the host integration.

---

## 6. Cross-cutting decisions to resolve

- **Dual routing.** `inker::routing` (engine-id, live) stays canonical; harvest
  `register-viewer`'s capability/conformance declarations into it. Resolve when
  meerkat first routes >1 content engine.
- **Two graph-persistence formats.** Pick serde `graph.json` (inspectable,
  linked-data-compatible) as the live session store; reserve the kernel's `rkyv`
  `persistence.rs` path for a later compaction tier. No parallel store.
- **Three fetch lanes stay distinct.** `netfetcher` (WHATWG HTTP), `eidetic`-fetchers
  (content-addressed blob), `transport` (P2P) serve different policies; defer any
  convergence until duplication bites.
- **Unify the two Camera types** (mere-app center-based, platen offset-based) into one
  host-neutral Camera (flip D5).
- **Keep the two capability layers separate.** In-process gates
  (`kernel::permissions`, most-restrictive-wins) vs the federation capability stack
  (Meadowcap cluster-path caps + Biscuit policy + p2panda group-key). Do not conflate.
- **`EngramId` → `eidetic::ManifestId`** at the consolidation bridge; do not let the
  placeholder string become a parallel identity.
- **STM TTL vs eidetic no-GC.** Short-term sidecars (session-runtime) own sweep;
  eidetic engrams are durable-by-default.
- **Pick one `genet-winit-host`** (mere's is live; confirm genet's copy is
  reference, not a drifting fork).
- **Narrow `kernel::host_toolkit.rs`** — it still enumerates Iced/Gpui/Egui/Makepad
  host adapters, a multi-adapter assumption that predates the genet-only flip.

---

## 7. Cleanup + doc reconciliation

Schedule these so they stop polluting the topology and misleading readers:

- **Delete graph-canvas — DONE 2026-06-05.** Extracted the full IR cluster
  (`{camera, packet, projection, scene, scripting}`, not just the 4 headline types;
  `Color` was already in `kernel::paint`) into the new `canvas-ir` crate
  (deps: kernel/aether/euclid/serde); re-pointed `graph-layout` (~10 files) +
  `platen::canvas_scene`; dropped stale graph-canvas deps from
  `cartography`/`document-canvas`/`embed`; deleted the behavioral modules; rewired the
  workspace. Targeted tests green (canvas-ir 57, graph-layout 14, platen 130,
  cartography 44); meerkat builds. *(2026-06-10: this was an intermediate
  state — `canvas-ir` + `graph-layout` were deleted 2026-06-07 and the
   keep-worthy layouts recaptured into `crates/orrery/arrangements` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->; topology
  §8 is the receipt.)*
- **Relocate `kernel` + `cartography` + `graph-layout` out of `crates/graphshell/`**
  (R4, pure move) — kernel-under-shell is upside down.
- **Sync `crates/graphshell/README.md`** to drop the cut `host-ports/` /
  `register-renderer/` / `control-plane/` / `spatial-substrate/` rows.
- **Mark superseded (not delete)**: `host_architecture_roadmap`, the
  `renderer_registry_contract`/`spatial_chrome_ir`/`xilem_embedding` briefs,
  `typed_action_bus_plan`, the between-tiles seam §4, the verso adoption + scrying
  integration host-wiring (the crates survive; the Masonry/Xilem wiring is dead),
  and the p2p docs' stale code-state (the 06-01 p2panda spike + 06-02 LogSync plans
  are canonical current-state).
- **Fix stale headers**: `platen/lib.rs` ("document-canvas planned" — it exists),
  `murmuring/lib.rs` ("Cable wire coming"), the eidetic hash-agility open-questions
  (multihash Hash shipped), and re-root "mere-host-runtime" doc paths onto
  `session-runtime` + meerkat.
- Per DOC_POLICY: update `DOC_README.md` for any doc add/move (done this session for
  this plan), and carry the R0 invariant contracts (a11y capability, 5-scope
  permissions, temporal-integrity, three-pass Chrome→Content→Overlay compositor,
  undo-classification) as guardrails cited per-slice.

---

## 8. Explicitly deferred

geist / LLM serving / Distillery / LoRA-as-engram; `net-media` (WebRTC + decode);
federation proper (moot graph-view CRDT, mooting adapters, bridges, tier machinery);
group-key E2EE (p2panda-spaces vs Keyhive — both pre-v1, watch, do not adopt);
Biscuit policy over tessera facts; Veilid per-moot transport; advanced tear-out
(branch/fork) + nonstandard browsing profiles; SPARQL/Oxigraph content-subgraph
projection. None gate the host integration; each rides its own lane when a real
consumer appears.

---

## Findings

### 2026-09-05 — scope and open-tail review

- The graph-rooted shell rule is retained as the historical browser/Meerkat
  product choice recorded here. It is superseded as a Mere-wide architecture by
  the [platform boundary and repository topology plan](2026-09-02_platform_boundary_and_repository_topology_plan.md),
  which assigns Mere the Cambium UI, scene, composition, projection-policy, and
  session/workspace lanes.
- The family-level model is now the [family composition thesis](../../2026-08-12_family_composition_thesis_brief.md):
  applications keep their own source truth, while Graphshell is a composable
  projection capability. The [composition spine](../technical_architecture/2026-05-21_mere_composition_spine.md)
  remains canonical for arrangement ontology, but its older host rows require the
  current boundary plan's reading.
- Historical tail topics route to current owners: S5 comms and sync in the
  active [Murm peer runtime and Moot domain plan](2026-07-12_murm_peer_runtime_and_moot_domain_plan.md)
  and the active [Moot collections and community publishing plan](../../moothold_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-06-12_moot_object_m1_plan.md);
  S6 external content in the [Scrying tile plan](2026-06-10_scrying_tile_plan.md);
  S7 retirement and documentation reconciliation in the platform plan's P7
  section. Pandect already owns `hidden_relations` persistence in
  [`view_intent_store.rs`](../../../crates/system/pandect/src/view_intent_store.rs)
  and restores it through `live_view.rs`; any per-family visibility UI requires
  a current consumer audit before reactivation.

## Progress

- **2026-09-05 — scoped reconciliation.** Corrected the historical-tail review:
  S5/S6 references route topics to their current owner plans without asserting
  unverified implementation status, and Pandect's existing
  `hidden_relations` save/reopen path is recorded as the persistence owner.

- **2026-06-02** — Plan created from a whole-corpus read (7-track read-only fan-out
  over ~50 docs + crate verification). Settled the architecture root question with
  Mark: the graph is the sole root, the orrery is its spatial presentation, and the
  workbench/gloss/apparatus/tiles are contingent projections (no inversion). Recorded
  the leverage surface (most parts built + host-neutral), the integration gaps, the
  lane model + near-term sequence (S1 orrery-as-content-root → S2 node-media+fetch →
  S3 persistence → S4 workbench → S5 comms → S6 external → S7 cutover+cleanup), the
  cross-cutting decisions, and the cleanup/doc-reconciliation list. No code this pass;
  next is S1 (fold orrery-host into meerkat as the content-root).
- **2026-06-02 — S1 (substance) done: orrery is meerkat's content-root.**
  - *S1.1* (`64ebe44`): extracted orrery-host's standalone `App` into a reusable,
    window-agnostic `Orrery` lib (`orrery-host` gained a `[lib]` target) —
    `frame(w, h) -> (Scene, needs_redraw)` (composites the underlay + abs-pos node
    pool + marquee; no present) plus semantic input methods (`pointer_down`/`up`,
    `cursor_moved`, `wheel`, `set_ctrl`, `reseed`) returning a redraw flag, and a
    `PointerButton` enum. Construction + paint/DOM helpers split into `build.rs`
    (every file < the 600-LOC ceiling: lib 481, build 226, main 190). The bin is now
    a thin winit shell over the lib. 6/6 lib tests pass.
  - *S1.2* (`8786484`): meerkat depends on the orrery-host lib; the content band
    below the chrome is now an `Orrery` instead of synthesized HTML. `render()`
    composites the orrery's scene at the content band and chains a redraw while it
    animates; content-band input (cursor / wheel / press / release / modifiers)
    routes to the orrery in band-local coordinates; the chrome band keeps its
    hit-test. Removed the synthesized content seam (`content.rs` + the `content`
    module). 31/31 meerkat lib tests pass; meerkat builds clean.
  - *Deferred*: the orrery-host bin's **physical** retirement (gap #2's last step)
    folds into the S7 cutover, alongside `mere-app`, rather than deleting a working
    isolated harness mid-stream. It shares the `Orrery` lib + `genet-winit-host`
    with meerkat (no divergent engine), so it is a lib test-harness bin, not a
    competing app host. Done-condition for S1's interactive-orrery-in-the-shell is
    met; only the cleanup tail moves.
- **2026-06-02 — S2 (synchronous browse loop) done; real fetch (S2.2b) is next.**
  - *S2.1* (`df50602`): `Orrery::visit(url)` grows the session graph as you navigate
    — URL identity selects an existing node, else a new node is added and linked from
    the current selection (the browse trail as graph structure), re-syncing physics +
    the node pool and re-settling. `Orrery::new` now starts empty; the sample ring
    moved to `with_sample_graph` (bin + tests). meerkat seeds the root from the
    initial location and `visit`s after each navigation. 8 orrery lib tests.
  - *S2.2a* (`415bd88`): the focused node's media renders as a **floating card** over
    the orrery (Mark's placement pick; composite order orrery → card → chrome). Proves
    the document pipeline in the shell: `node_document(url)` (synthesized content,
    synchronous) → `layout_document` → `scene_from_packet` → composited card, cached
    by `(url, size)`. `Orrery::focused_url()` feeds it. meerkat gained inker +
    document-canvas (netrender feature); 4 card tests. Only the byte source is a stub.
- **2026-06-02 — S2.2b done: real fetch + content-type routing. S2 complete.**
  - *S2.2b-i* (`1d9d9c0`): off-UI-thread fetch. `meerkat::fetch` runs netfetcher on a
    tokio worker; outcomes return over an `mpsc` channel and wake the loop via an
    `EventLoopProxy<()>` (delivery model 2), drained in `user_event`. Per-URL content
    cache (Loading / Ready / Failed) keyed by URL identity; the card shows real
    loading + error states. Deps: netfetcher (sibling), url, tokio. 6 bin tests.
  - *S2.2b-ii* (`7c03a93`): content-type routing. A nematic `EngineRegistry`
    (markdown / gemtext / plain / feeds) feeds the document lane; `text/html` rides
    the **genet lane** (`set_inner_html` → `scene_from_scripted_dom`), confirming
    Mark's point that genet is free here (already the host). 10 bin tests
    (markdown-through-nematic + HTML-through-genet). Deps: nematic.
  - The full graph-rooted browse loop now runs: navigate → graph grows a linked node
    → fetch off-thread → route by type → the focused node's media renders as a card,
    chrome on top. The async-host seam (worker + channel + proxy wake) is the
    foundation S3 (persistence flush) and S5 (murm sync) push results through.
  - *Process note*: `Cargo.lock` left unstaged across S2.2b — a sibling crate's
    concurrent fastbloom/zstd change is interleaved in the shared lock; the next lock
    commit carries meerkat's netfetcher / tokio / url / nematic entries with it.
  - *Deferred from S2*: durable `FetchContext` (cookie jar / cache / real CSP) instead
    of `permissive()`; binary media; page-supplied CSS in the genet HTML lane.
- **2026-06-02 — S3.1 done: the session graph survives restart.**
  - `session-runtime::session_graph_store` (`900253e`, native-only): `save` / `load`
    the graph through its serde `GraphSnapshot` (URL-stable) as pretty `graph.json`,
    plus a `sessions/<id>` path helper for when manifests thread the session id.
  - `orrery-host`: `Orrery::with_graph` restores a graph keeping each node's saved
    position (no spiral re-seed, no auto-settle), and `graph()` exposes it to persist.
  - `meerkat`: loads `<data_dir>/mere/graph.json` on launch (else seeds fresh from the
    initial location) and saves after each navigation; load failure falls back to a
    fresh session. Deps add session-runtime + dirs. 3 store + 10 orrery tests pass.
  - *Next (S3.2)*: persona / session / manifest threading (the `ManifestStore` +
    `sessions/<id>` layout exist), camera + focused-node restore via
    `view_intent_store::CameraSnapshot`, and the eidetic content store for media.
  - *Also batched this session* (`91d94bd` + `f93a257`): committed the concurrent
    working tree on request — the p2panda/p2p + social lane (murm / transport /
    persona / moothold-tessera / probes / docs) and the register-renderer-types
    scaffold. Not build-verified here (sibling-agent WIP); two new p2p/tessera docs
    are committed without `DOC_README` index lines (flagged for their authors).
- **2026-06-03 — S3.2a done: the camera survives restart.**
  - `orrery-host`: `CameraView` (plain pan + zoom) with `camera()` / `set_camera()`
    (guards a non-finite / zero zoom, clamps to range).
  - `meerkat` (`8de3946`): `<data_dir>/mere` is the session dir (`graph.json` +
    `views/` siblings, per the view-intent spec); the camera maps to/from the
    `CameraSnapshot` affine and restores on launch (suppressing the first-frame
    recenter); graph + camera save after each navigation and on window close. Reuses
    `view_intent_store` (atomic writes); no new deps. 11 orrery + 11 meerkat tests.
  - The genet HTML lane also gained page-supplied inline `<style>` layering
    (`inline_stylesheets_from_source`), landed alongside by a sibling change.
  - *Next (S3.2b)*: `ViewIntent.focus` to re-open the focused node's card on reload;
    persona / session / manifest threading; the eidetic content store for media.
- **2026-06-03 — S3.2b done: the focused node survives restart. View-intent complete.**
  - `session-runtime` (`fe5fdd3`): `ViewIntent` gained a `focus` field (the focused
    node's URL, by URL identity); `is_empty` + a round-trip test updated. Two distinct
    `ViewIntent` types exist — this persistence one (extended) vs `cartography`'s
    projection-request one (`focus: Option<NodeKey>`); the persistence one is URL-keyed.
  - `orrery-host`: `Orrery::select_by_url` re-selects an existing node by URL without
    adding one. `meerkat`: saves the focused URL with the camera, re-selects it on
    launch after the graph + camera restore. 10 view-intent + 12 orrery tests pass.
  - **View-intent persistence is complete**: graph (S3.1) + camera (S3.2a) + focus
    (S3.2b) all survive restart. *Remaining S3.2c*: persona / manifest threading for
    multi-session / multi-window, and the eidetic content store (no re-fetch on reload).
- **2026-06-03 — S3.2c (content store) + S4 + P4 shipped.** A durable content store
  and the tiled workbench landed; the field was clear (sibling on docs / research).
  - *S3.2c content store* (`45b448d` primitive over `eidetic::Store`; wired `a4253f0`):
    fetched pages + subresources persist through an eidetic fjall store under the
    session dir, so a reload shows them without re-fetching. Persona / manifest
    threading held (overlaps the sibling's active tessera persona work).
  - *Dark mode* (`c0df60e`): orrery + chrome + synthesized / nematic cards go dark;
    fetched HTML stays faithful (light, as authored). A light variant + toggle is a
    future setting (the named seams are isolated).
  - *S4 workbench composition* (`84c7771`): `platen::workbench::Workbench` — holds
    the open tiles + projection mode, builds a forme `Arrangement`, projects it with
    platen `project_tree` → `layout_plan` (morphorm rects). The discovery: forme +
    platen already had the portable pipeline, tested. The orrery (Cartography) and
    the tiled workbench (Tree) are two projections of one arrangement.
  - *P4 per-tile actors* (`6f82bce`, lifecycle `6c3b9a2`, perf `ffd3d14`): Ctrl+T
    tiles the workbench, each tile its own `spawn_content` actor (the constellation
    goes plural); the hidden orrery is skipped while tiled (perf).
- **2026-06-04 — The by-hand-tiles UX arc (node activation, curation, settings, tile chrome).**
  - *Activation lifecycle* (`10618a8`): extracted `meerkat::constellation` — one pool
    of active nodes; the focused card and the tiles share it (dormant ↔ active ↔
    background), reconciled to the needed set each frame. Then **flipped to keep-warm
    tabs** (`e48e0f2`): an opened node stays a warm tab (actor alive) until closed or
    LRU-evicted over the cap (default 12; `Constellation::set_cap`). Background shifts
    from "stay alive" (now every tab's default) to "keep working + exempt eviction".
  - *Gestures + palette* (`9f5af2c`, `e107231`): delete-node, background-keep, and
    toggle-workbench surfaced as command-palette verbs via a pending-host-intent
    pattern (the chrome records, the host drains).
  - *Edge visibility* (`37709fe`): platen gained a relation-level edge-visibility
    predicate (`Fn(&RelationView) -> bool`, before the pair-collapse); the orrery
    hides / shows selected edges (display-only; relations persist), surfaced as
    palette verbs. Per-family toggles + `hidden_relations` persistence are follow-ons.
  - *Node colors* (`f2caa07`, `db178d8`): green = open (a live actor shows Ready
    content), red = closed (Ready content, no actor), blue = idle (local / settings /
    synthesized / blank / errored). Pushed from the host's actor pool + content cache.
  - *Selection-driven open* (`364fd4a`): single-select opens the active tabs in the
    node's graphlet (orrery BFS over the connected component); multi-select opens the
    selection in splits.
  - *Settings overlay* (`e1b5dd8`, fixes `f7c5dc4`): a chrome overlay (xilem-serval,
    same shape as the palette) with the active-tab cap control; a workbench toggle
    button next to the omnibar; settings close on × / Escape (backdrop-close dropped).
  - *Tile chrome* (`5768c62`): each tile gets a header strip (label + pin + close),
    abs-positioned chrome interactive through the existing click path. Close reaps the
    tab; pin toggles background. Content renders below the strip.
  - *Composable tiles* (`6fb6e01`): the workbench reshaped from one-member tiles to
    slots that each hold a stack of members (a tab strip, one visible at a time). One
    platen tile-intent per slot lays the columns; the slot carves its own strip and
    owns its tab set + active index (not platen's `Tabs` slot). Clicking a tab switches
    the stack instantly, since every tab stays a warm actor (reconcile covers all tabs,
    only the visible one is driven). `group_all` / `split_all` collapse and separate.
  - *Right-click context menu* (`73c5d6a`): right-clicking the orrery over a selection
    floats a menu at the cursor to tile that selection's working set, either each in
    its own split or gathered into one stack. The working set is shared with entering
    the workbench (multi-select is its nodes; single-select expands to the active
    graphlet). `open_split` / `open_stack` on the workbench; the chrome renders the
    menu, the host computes the rows and drains the choice.
  - *Settings persistence* (`847ebfd`): a `settings.json` sidecar in session-runtime
    (`settings_store`, the view-intent sidecar's I/O shape) persists the active-tab
    cap. The host loads it before building the chrome (overlay + pool open at the saved
    value) and saves on change only.
  - *Remaining*: the S5 comms tail (sync status UI, connect-by-ticket polish), S6
    external content re-home, S7 cutover + cleanup. Per-family edge toggles and
    `hidden_relations` persistence stay follow-ons.
