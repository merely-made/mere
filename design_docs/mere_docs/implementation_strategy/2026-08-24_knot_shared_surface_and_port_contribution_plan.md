# Knot Shared Surface and Port Contribution Plan

> **Repository note (2026-09-04):** Knot Editor is an independent repository,
> consumed by Djinn and Turnstone from one immutable revision; its sources left
> Mere under E2 of `knot-editor/design_docs/2026-09-01_knot_editor_repository_extraction_plan.md`,
> so the `ports/knot` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> paths below name the layout each receipt landed against.

**Date:** 2026-08-24
**Status:** in progress; current-origin G0 and the narrow `knot-document`
package published; K0, the reusable Knot surface, desktop wrapper, and semantic
host receipt implemented and independently green; Turnstone T0 consumer core
and user invocation landed, including explicit read-only admission; generic
accessibility landed; P0 is complete — Turnstone admits
`distillery.installed.v1` through the existing registry with no
provider-specific renderer arm, the full shell binary builds from published
sources, and the contract is reduced and frozen at v1 (Genet `001448d55`,
Turnstone `3f63671`); F0 is the next gated lane
**Scope:** prove one Knot document surface in a standalone host and Turnstone,
then prove the contribution seam with a second port. This plan does not require
or privilege a `.knot` container format, a subprocess boundary, or a universal
plugin API.

## 1. Ruling

Knot is a Mere port and a useful application by itself. Its first product is a
Djot-native editor over files in place, with a graph substrate, local search,
portable referenced evidence, and peer replication. Standalone Knot and
Turnstone consume the same Knot product model and Cambium surface.

Turnstone is the compositor. It owns placement, window and pane lifetime,
focus, layout, hit testing, theme, AccessKit hosting, and shell policy. Knot
owns document authority, edits, saves, revisions, evidence, replication, and
refusals. Djinn owns the selected persona's durable resident stores and network
runtimes when that resident mode is selected.

The first forcing surface is `knot.document.v1`: one selected document with an
editor body and a compact status header. The header reports source identity,
format, dirty state, write posture, and the last save outcome. Whole-vault,
watcher, replication, evidence, and sharing dashboards follow after this seam
works in two hosts.

## 2. Findings

### 2026-08-24: the closed seam is larger than `PaneRenderer`

Turnstone's `PaneRenderer` and `BUILTIN_PANES` are closed, but the retained
runtime is also closed. `PaneRenderers` stores one concrete `HashMap<PaneId,
T>` per pane type, and rendering, input, scroll, visibility, and eviction fan
out over those maps. Replacing only the registry enum would leave the runtime
closed.

The live pane plan assigns the namespaced `External` source and built-in
registry to landed A1. A2 remains the graph runtime pool and `PaneId` /
`graph_id` propagation lane. This plan owns the port-contribution seam. A Knot
surface uses A2 only when it actually needs multi-graph context.

### 2026-08-24: `AnyView` does not erase a product session

Cambium's `AnyView` erases a concrete child tree while keeping its `State` and
`Action` types static. Turnstone cannot store arbitrary product-owned runners
as `Box<dyn AnyView<...>>` without adopting each product's state or action
enum. The erased boundary must surround the retained runner itself.

### 2026-08-24: description and runtime are different contracts

The earlier `SurfaceContributionV1` mixed stable metadata, a Rust factory,
live capability facts, commands, and settings. That shape cannot be one
serializable record and would duplicate existing command and settings seams.
The corrected boundary has three parts:

1. a data-only `SurfaceDescriptor`;
2. a provider factory that admits a source and returns a retained session or a
   typed unavailable result;
3. an object-safe retained Cambium session whose concrete product state and
   actions remain hidden.

Turnstone A6 remains the shell command/provider registry.
`genet-host-api::SettingsProvider` and `SettingsRef` remain the settings seam.
A surface descriptor may name those providers or references later; it does not
copy their rows or values.

### 2026-08-24: Knot has pieces, not one global status model

`KnotEditor`, the file writer, vault, watcher, sync store, evidence custody,
and publishing routes are live, but there is no single truthful snapshot that
folds all of them. Requiring that snapshot before the first standalone UI would
hide a large integration project inside a status pane. The first model is one
document session. Broader status is promoted one authority at a time.

### 2026-08-24: Djot is the first authoring route

The newer Knot lane brief rules that authored format is Djot and that `.knot`
remains only a compatibility spelling until a later portable-object consumer
requires more than Djot plus content references. Older completed plans and the
live `KnotEditor` still privilege `.knot`. K0 corrects the live admission path
and uses `.djot` for its receipt; this composition work does not revive the
superseded format assumption.

### 2026-08-24: the editor model is already duplicated

Genet's `knot-editor-host::KnotEditor` already owns the authority-free
`TextInput`, dirty baseline, edit commands, and derived readout, and Turnstone
uses it. `ports/knot::KnotEditor` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> independently repeats that state while adding
file authority. K0 changes the port editor into a file-authority wrapper around
the Genet model. The new document session composes that wrapper; it does not
create a third source buffer or editor core.

### 2026-08-24: the standalone process mode must be explicit

Local directory mode may hold its authority in the standalone Knot process.
Persona-vault and replicated modes use the one Djinn-owned resident session
when configured. A host must not open a second owner over the same resident
stores. The first receipt uses a selected local file, so it does not depend on
Djinn or a subprocess.

### 2026-08-24: Rootstock already owns the standalone host topology

Genet's `cambium-rootstock` already owns windowing-neutral retained layout,
hit testing, pointer/key/IME/wheel routing, focus, accessibility, and frame
lifecycle. `cambium-genet-winit-host` supplies the desktop event source and
presentation adapter. Standalone Knot should be a product state, view, and hook
set on that host. It must not create another event loop, layout wrapper, or
input vocabulary. G0 erases the concrete runner boundary only; Rootstock and
the host continue to route events around it.

### 2026-08-24: the UI and host must borrow the same text input

The first contract review found one adapter requirement, not a new model. A
Knot component renders the existing `TextInput`, and Rootstock's focused-text
hook must mutably reach that exact input for IME, selection, and caret defaults.
`KnotEditor` and `KnotDocumentSession` therefore expose shared and mutable
borrows of the delegated input. They do not expose a replacement setter or a
second text value.

The retained runtime needs no Knot method. A product-owned constructor can
build its concrete `GenetAppRunner`, consume Knot intents inside its own view,
then return `Box<dyn RetainedSurfaceSession>`. Standalone Knot may use the same
concrete state and view directly with Rootstock's generic host, while Turnstone
holds the erased form.

### 2026-08-24: surface effects belong with the retained runtime

The shared Genet checkout was behind current `origin/main`. Current
`genet-host-api` has intentionally removed its older raw host-input and
`HostEffect` vocabulary. Reintroducing that vocabulary for surfaces would
reverse the cleanup and mix a data contract with a live Cambium runtime.

The current-origin G0 keeps descriptors and typed availability in
`genet-host-api`. Cambium owns the object-safe runner session and its present
minimum effect, `SurfaceEffect::Redraw`. Native input still enters through the
existing Rootstock adapters, and commands, settings, navigation, and cursor
policy stay in their existing seams until a real surface consumer requires a
generic runtime effect.

### 2026-08-25: the small surface still pays for the broad port graph

An external verification crate depending only on `ports/knot` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> and the desktop
host still spends dependency resolution on Knot's full ordinary dependency
set. Both the branch-sourced Genet run and an exact clean-current-origin
checkout run remained in Cargo resolution without reaching `rustc` inside the
verification bound. This is not a code failure, but it leaves the Mere
published-source receipt open and exposes a packaging cost.

Do not create another document model to fix that cost. If a lock-seeded
published-source rerun does not clear it, extract the reusable document
surface and thin desktop wrapper into a narrow Knot UI package that depends on
the existing `KnotDocumentSession`. Turnstone should not inherit unrelated
vault, inference, replication, or endpoint dependencies merely to mount one
document surface.

### 2026-08-25: the document surface now has its own dependency boundary

`knot-document` now owns the existing editor wrapper, one-document session,
writer, Cambium component, and erased-session constructor. Its default feature
set keeps the one `TextInput`, native file writes, status, and surface while
leaving parsing, preview, canonicalization, Inker, and Nematic behind `engine`.
The broad `knot-editor` port enables that feature and re-exports the old API;
the standalone binary lives in an excluded `knot-desktop` wrapper so ordinary
Mere resolution no longer acquires the Winit host.

An independent package mirror using exact current-origin Genet sources reached
`rustc` and passed five default tests. The engine-feature pass passed eleven
tests, including the restored conversion and preview receipts. Nematic's HTML
fragment default is disabled for this dependency because Knot uses only its
Djot and Markdown engines. The remaining engine cost is Nematic's current
unconditional Errand dependency, not Knot vault, replication, inference, or
endpoint code.

### 2026-08-26: the pre-freeze census

With both providers admitted, every contract item was censused across its
three homes: the Genet definitions (`genet-host-api/surface.rs` and
`cambium/src/surface.rs`, untouched since founding commit `bbd0906`, with no
consumer inside Genet), the two mere providers (`knot-document`,
`distillery`), and the one erased host (Turnstone's `contributed_surface`).
Standalone Knot bypasses the erasure by design and consumes the concrete
state/view directly, so Turnstone is the seam's only host.

**Load-bearing on both sides** — eleven of the fourteen
`RetainedSurfaceSession` methods (`descriptor`, `availability`, `dom`,
`focus`, `set_focus`, `focus_traverse`, `pointer_target`, `hover_target`,
`wheel_target`, `sync_viewport`, `dispatch`); all seven
`ResolvedSurfaceEvent` variants through Turnstone's one dispatch funnel;
`RunnerSurfaceSession::new` with its five product-owned parts;
`SurfaceEffect::Redraw` (the sole variant, matched at the host);
`SurfaceViewport` width/height (Sky reads them; `scale_factor` is consulted
only by Cambium's own dedup); and the descriptor identity trio the host
actually reads: `provider_id` and `surface_id` (registry dedup) plus `label`
(AccessKit root name and the unavailable view).

**Dead trait surface** — `root()`, `focusables()`, and `pointer_capture()`
have no caller in any repository.

**Descriptor fields set but never read** — `accepted_source` (admission is
gated by Turnstone's `SurfaceProvider::source_schema()` instead, a second
source of truth for the same fact), `roles`, `multiplicity` (shadowed by
Turnstone's own `PaneMultiplicity`), `placement_hint` (all three providers
say `"main"`), and `potential_capabilities` with `CapabilityId` (read only
by one Sky unit test). `SurfaceSourceShape::None`/`Many` and every
`SurfaceMultiplicity` variant except `PerSource` are never constructed.

**Availability in practice** — all three providers' live availability
closures return `Available` unconditionally; production unavailability
exists only as admission-time error translation into the generic
unavailable session. Four of the eight `SurfaceUnavailableReason` variants
are produced (`Absent`, `Denied`, `Unsupported`, `Other`, all by the Knot
provider), rendered through one `Debug` format rather than per-variant
branches; `Locked` is test-only; `Stale`, `Unconfigured`, and `Unhealthy`
are unexercised but are exactly the states §F0 names for future snapshots.

**The freeze decisions this forces** (F-1 ruled 2026-08-26: unify; the
rest scoped below and open until ruled):

- **F-1, `accepted_source` — ruled: unify.** Registration asserts the
  descriptor's declared source kind equals the provider's admission schema,
  making the descriptor the stated truth the host enforces and turning
  today's silent redundancy into a checked invariant.
- **F-2, the unread descriptor tail.** Provenance of each field's intended
  consumer, traced 2026-08-26:
  - `potential_capabilities`/`CapabilityId` and `roles`/`SurfaceRole` were
    seeded for the suite-composition census's routing pipeline (address →
    advertised capabilities → compatible surface offers) and its §8
    per-role handler preference. That scheme was never assigned a lane, and
    its explicit role vocabulary (`view, edit, manage, …`) was adopted by
    neither real provider (Knot says `document`/`editor`, Distillery says
    `pane`/`status`).
  - `placement_hint` has no consumer beyond a one-line "host owns
    placement" aspiration; Turnstone's own hardcoded `PlacementPolicy` per
    pane definition governs in practice and never reads it.
  - `multiplicity`/`SurfaceMultiplicity` is a parallel invention of
    Turnstone's `PaneMultiplicity` (A1, landed, hardened by the 2026-08-16
    duplicate-pane incident); no bridge between the two was ever proposed.
  Recommendation stands: cut all four from v1, leaving identity, `label`,
  and `accepted_source`. If the capability-routing pipeline ever gets a
  lane, capabilities and roles return additively with it.
- **F-3, the uncalled trait methods — recommendation revised by scoping.**
  All three mirror load-bearing concrete-host machinery, not speculation:
  `pointer_capture()` is how `cambium-rootstock` computes correct local
  coordinates mid-drag (`input.rs` reads it before every captured
  move/up), and an erased host must consult it before building
  `PointerMove` events the moment a contributed surface carries any
  `on_pointer` widget (slider, split, resize handle, reorderable list,
  graph canvas); `focusables()` is the runner's half of the shipped
  spatial 2D focus navigation, which geometry-blind `focus_traverse()`
  structurally cannot replace; `root()` names the runner's own subtree in
  a shared document, the question two production hosts already answer with
  the concrete counterpart. Revised recommendation: keep all three.
  Corollary finding: Turnstone's contributed pane path currently forwards
  pointer moves without consulting `pointer_capture()`, a latent
  correctness gap for the first drag-widget surface — noted for T-lane
  follow-up rather than fixed here.
- **F-4, unavailable-reason breadth**: the four unproduced variants map
  variant-for-variant onto §F0's named snapshot states (locked vault,
  stale resident snapshot, unconfigured provider, unhealthy resident), and
  F0 is live gated work now that P0's proof is complete. Recommendation
  stands: keep all eight.

Reduction is a breaking Genet change: one commit over the two contract
modules and their tests, module docs declaring the v1 freeze (additive-only
until a v2), a Cambium changelog entry, then a Genet rev bump consumed by
mere and Turnstone through the established alignment cadence. Expected
churn outside Genet: the two mere descriptor literals shrink; Turnstone
needs nothing beyond the rev bump.

### 2026-09-05: contract completion and host interaction are separate receipts

P0 remains complete. A live-code check confirms the older T-lane capture
finding still applies: `turnstone/src/contributed_surface.rs::pointer` builds
move/up events from pane coordinates and pane size without consulting
`RetainedSurfaceSession::pointer_capture`. The shell retains the pane during a
drag, but that does not supply the captured widget's local coordinates.
`crates/cambium/cambium-rootstock/src/input.rs` demonstrates the existing
captured-element routing; the frozen trait already exposes the needed target.

Before promoting a contributed drag-widget surface, the Turnstone consumer
receipt must cover a widget offset inside a scrolled pane, movement outside
the widget, and release, with events expressed in the captured widget's frame.
This is host-adoption work under T0's routing scope, not a reason to reopen the
v1 descriptor/trait freeze or duplicate the surface contract. F0 remains the
separate broader Knot authority-surface work.

## 3. Boundary

```text
Knot source authority
        |
KnotDocumentSession
snapshot + typed intent
        |
product-owned Cambium runner
        |
Box<dyn RetainedSurfaceSession>
        |
standalone Genet host | Turnstone pane host
```

### 3.1 Data-only description

`genet-host-api` owns product-neutral descriptive vocabulary:

```text
SurfaceDescriptor {
    provider_id
    surface_id
    label
    accepted_source
    roles
    multiplicity
    placement_hint
    potential_capabilities
}
```

This sketch is illustrative. G0 establishes the compile-ready names.

The descriptor contains stable facts. Current availability belongs to an
admitted session. Executable factories, command handlers, setting values,
resident handles, and product snapshots do not live in the descriptor.

### 3.2 Retained Cambium session

Cambium owns an object-safe `RetainedSurfaceSession` because it already owns
`GenetAppRunner`, DOM event dispatch, focus, and retained component state. A
session exposes:

- its descriptor and current typed availability;
- the retained `DomHandle` and root node used for rendering, accessibility,
  and automation;
- viewport synchronization;
- dispatch after the host has translated native input and resolved a target;
- host effects such as redraw, cursor change, and navigation.

The host still owns layout, hit testing, scene conversion, scrolling policy,
AccessKit root geometry, and lifecycle. Product intents are consumed inside
the product session. Only generic host effects cross back out.

The first implementation erases two different concrete `GenetAppRunner`
types into one collection. That compile receipt is the gate. A trait that only
wraps a fake view is insufficient.

### 3.3 Knot document model

Knot owns:

- `KnotDocumentSnapshotV1`: source identity, display label, document format,
  text, selection, dirty state, write posture, last save outcome, and an
  optional typed refusal;
- `KnotDocumentIntentV1`: edit and save for the first slice;
- `KnotDocumentSession`: opens or creates the existing `KnotEditor`, emits the
  snapshot, applies intents through that editor, and never creates a second
  source buffer.

Close and reopen are host lifecycle operations. Save-as waits for the native
file-selection contract rather than putting platform paths into a portable UI
event.

## 4. Parallel workload

### G0. Neutral descriptor and retained runtime erasure

**Owner:** Genet.
**Files:** `components/genet-host-api/{lib.rs,surface.rs}` and
`components/cambium/cambium/src/{lib.rs,surface.rs}` only, plus focused tests
inside those files.
**Runs beside:** K0.

Implement the data-only descriptor and typed availability in
`genet-host-api`. Implement the object-safe retained-session boundary in
Cambium, using existing Cambium, Rootstock, and host input/effect vocabulary
and the retained DOM. Do not duplicate Rootstock's layout, hit testing, raw
input translation, focus policy, or accessibility machinery.
Prove two concrete runner state/view types coexist as boxed sessions and retain
independent state.

Done when the focused Genet tests compile and pass, the host API remains below
Cambium in the dependency graph, and the runtime trait does not mention Knot,
Turnstone, `sceno::Scene`, winit, or platform AccessKit adapters.

### K0. Narrow Knot document snapshot, intent, and session

**Owner:** Mere `ports/knot` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->.
**Files:** `ports/knot/src/{lib.rs,document_surface.rs}` and the smallest
necessary additions to `ports/knot/src/editor.rs` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> only.
**Runs beside:** G0.

Implement the first product model over the existing `KnotEditor`. The session
opens one local `.djot` file, reports its snapshot, applies edit/save intents,
and returns typed refusal for an unavailable save target. Remove the editor's
current `.knot`-only admission rule; legacy `.knot` may remain accepted, but
the first receipt and default product path are Djot. It must use `TextInput` as
the sole mutable source. Refactor the port editor to delegate that buffer,
dirty baseline, and derived readout to `knot-editor-host::KnotEditor`; the port
wrapper keeps path, format, and write authority.

Done when a focused test opens a real fixture, observes clean state, edits,
observes dirty state, saves, drops the session, reopens the file, and observes
the saved text and clean state. A scratch session must refuse save honestly.

### I0. Contract review and adapter decision

**Owner:** primary architecture lane.
**Depends on:** G0 and K0.

Review the concrete APIs together. Remove vocabulary that exists only for one
consumer. Confirm the Knot session can be wrapped without exposing
`KnotDocumentIntentV1` to the host. Record any compile-driven correction here
before Turnstone work begins.

Done when the wrapper can be described without a Knot-specific method on the
runtime trait and without a Turnstone action type in Knot.

### S0a. Reusable Knot document component

**Owner:** Knot.
**Depends on:** I0.

Build the shared Cambium document component over `KnotDocumentSession`. The
component contains the editor and compact status header, consumes save intents
inside product state, and publishes both a concrete state/view pair and a
constructor for the erased retained-session form. It reuses the one delegated
`TextInput`.

Done when a real component test observes edit, dirty, save, and status through
the product state, and a boxed session exposes its descriptor and retained DOM
without a Knot-specific host method.

### S0b. Standalone Knot host

**Owner:** Knot plus a minimal Genet host.
**Depends on:** S0a.

Build a concrete standalone `knot` binary on `cambium-rootstock` through
`cambium-genet-winit-host`. The initial process opens one selected local file
and owns that local session in process. The host supplies file selection,
window lifecycle, Ctrl+S interception, focused-text borrowing, and a semantic
headed receipt around the shared component. It does not reimplement input,
layout, scene conversion, or accessibility.

Done when a headed or app-authored receipt opens, edits, saves, closes, and
reopens one file, plus shows one honest read-only or unavailable state.

### T0. Turnstone contribution consumer

**Owner:** Turnstone.
**Depends on:** S0b and landed A1. A2 is optional.

Add one dynamic retained-session map keyed by `PaneId`, plus provider
registration and source admission. The generic adapter owns Turnstone layout,
hit testing, scene conversion, scroll, focus, accessibility hosting, and
eviction around the boxed session. Mount `knot.document.v1` without a new
`PaneRenderer` arm or a concrete Knot map.

**Progress:** Turnstone `1e9dde1` lands registration, versioned source
admission, the erased retained-session map, render and pointer/key/IME routing,
focus, hover, scroll, repin replacement, and eviction. It mounts the published
Knot session and converts typed product unavailability into a generic retained
surface. Mere `709ae402` adds an explicit posture whose edit, save, and mutable
input routes refuse without mutation. Turnstone `a37e6a1` adds editable and
read-only file-choice commands, mints the selected path into the versioned
provider source, and inserts the legacy pane and matching blueprint atomically.
Source-bearing actions remain host-only because a pane grant must not imply
local-file authority. Genet `b8de627` and `4e60f93`, plus Turnstone `0c105a7`,
join each laid-out generic DOM to the shell's AccessKit tree with namespaced
identity, pane-translated painted bounds, real DOM focus, distinct Focus and
Click routing, hidden-node omission, live-region state, disabled-state
suppression, and Knot's editable versus read-only semantics.

Reuse A6 for commands and A7's `SettingsProvider` direction. Do not add command
or settings arrays to the surface descriptor. Preserve all existing Knot
authority and protocol receipts while changing only composition.

Done when standalone Knot and Turnstone mount the same product session and
Cambium component, and Turnstone renders unavailable and read-only states
through the generic session path.

### P0. Second-provider proof and contract freeze

**Owner:** primary architecture lane plus the selected port.
**Depends on:** T0.

Choose the independent provider with the smallest amount of new UI. Castellan
has a strong secret-free snapshot and typed intents but currently lacks a
Cambium application surface. Distillery or another port may be cheaper if it
already has a retained surface by this gate. The choice is made from the live
tree after T0, not frozen here.

Done when two unrelated products use the same descriptor and retained-session
mechanism, the second adds no provider-specific Turnstone renderer arm, and
the contract is then reduced and frozen.

### F0. Broader Knot surfaces

**Owner:** Knot authority lanes.
**Depends on:** P0 and the relevant resident receipts.

Promote broader status, evidence, and sharing surfaces one authority at a time.
Each snapshot distinguishes absent, denied, locked, stale, unconfigured, and
unhealthy states where those distinctions exist. Mounting a surface grants
projection only; every effect is rechecked by the owning authority.

Done when standalone Knot and Turnstone show the same state transitions and
neither host gains vault, resident, evidence-custody, or publishing authority
through UI admission.

## 5. Merge and ownership rules

- G0 and K0 may edit only their named files. They do not edit this plan,
  repository indexes, root manifests, lockfiles, or Turnstone.
- The primary lane reviews both implementations before either becomes a
  cross-repository dependency.
- The earlier Turnstone overlap in `Cargo.toml`, `cambium_pane.rs`,
  `chrome_view.rs`, `content.rs`, and `ui.rs` has cleared. T0 may begin after
  S0b and a fresh status check; those paths are still rechecked before any
  assignment because they are shared integration seams.
- Each repository is staged by explicit owned path after a fresh status check.
  Unrelated dirty work is preserved.
- A published-source or cross-repository build is required before changing a
  Git dependency consumer. Machine-local patch redirects do not count as that
  receipt.

## 6. Stop rules

- Do not create or privilege `.knot` for this work.
- Do not serialize a component tree.
- Do not put Rust factories or live capability facts in a data descriptor.
- Do not move Knot authority into Cambium, Turnstone, or Graphshell.
- Do not make A2 own provider contribution.
- Do not duplicate A6 commands or A7 settings.
- Do not build the global Knot status dashboard before the document surface
  proves the retained-session seam.
- Do not freeze the contract before an independent second provider uses it.

## 7. Progress

- 2026-08-24: primary review rejected the first execution order. It found the
  missing retained-runner erasure, split descriptor from live session, narrowed
  the first Knot model to one document, deferred broad status/evidence/sharing,
  and made second-provider selection depend on live UI readiness.
- 2026-08-24: G0 and K0 ran as compile-independent implementation lanes. G0
  added the data descriptor and object-safe runner erasure, including two
  concrete runner types in one collection. K0 added the Djot-first document
  session, shared-editor delegation, real save/reopen receipt, scratch refusal,
  and visible save failure.
- 2026-08-24: primary contract review retained the split boundary and added
  only shared and mutable borrows of the existing `TextInput`. It split S0 into
  the reusable component and its dependent desktop wrapper. The component is
  assigned as the first real erased-session consumer; the desktop wrapper
  follows its concrete API.
- 2026-08-24: live-origin review found the shared Genet checkout behind current
  `origin/main` and rejected publication of its stale `HostEffect` dependency.
  G0 was reapplied on current origin with data-only host contracts and the
  minimal `SurfaceEffect::Redraw` in Cambium. Its focused current-origin tests
  and publication are recorded below.
- 2026-08-24: S0a implemented the reusable status header, single-buffer Djot
  editor, product-owned save action, plain refusal/failure presentation,
  descriptor, concrete state/view pair, and erased-session constructor. S0b1
  wires that same concrete component to the existing Genet desktop host; S0b2
  proves the semantic host path below.
- 2026-08-24: current-origin G0 tests passed for `genet-host-api` and Cambium,
  including two explicitly named concrete runner view types in one erased
  collection. Genet commit `bbd09062804` published the four-file contract.
  S0b1 now opens a CLI-selected Djot file or honest scratch session through
  `cambium-genet-winit-host`, maps focused-text borrowing only to the actual
  textarea, and consumes Ctrl/Cmd+S inside Knot product state.
- 2026-08-24: S0b2 uses the existing Genet host `Harness`, not a product test
  driver. It resolves the editor by textbox role and label, focuses the actual
  textarea, injects text through Rootstock's key path, saves through the real
  Ctrl+S intercept, delivers the native close request, drops the host, and
  reopens the real Djot file clean. The actual winit/GPU presentation receipt
  remains a separate visual gate; it is not required to prove product state or
  input routing.
- 2026-08-24: Turnstone commit `f3cb758` records the corrected lane boundary:
  A2 owns the graph runtime pool and this plan owns port surface admission.
  The earlier overlapping Turnstone worktree paths are clear, so T0 is gated
  by the shared Knot publication rather than file ownership.
- 2026-08-25: an external consumer checked out current Genet `main` at
  `1ac3727`, which contains G0, in a private Cargo Git cache. A strict
  branch-source run and a second run using exact paths from that clean checkout
  both remained in dependency resolution without reaching `rustc` inside the
  verification bound. The implementation remains local for focused
  publication; the published-source receipt and the dependency-breadth choice
  remain open before T0.
- 2026-08-25: extracted `ports/knot-document` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> and the excluded
  `ports/knot/desktop` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> wrapper. The broad port preserves its API through
  re-exports and enables the optional engine conversion layer. An independent
  exact-current-origin verifier passed five default tests and eleven engine
  tests. This closes the dependency-breadth choice and local source receipt;
  Mere commit `fb82d12f` published the package through `origin/main` merge
  `80c2f17c`. Turnstone may now import the narrow package without acquiring the
  broad Knot port graph.
- 2026-08-25: Turnstone `1e9dde1` published the provider-neutral T0 consumer
  core without adding a `PaneRenderer` arm or concrete Knot session map. An
  isolated current-Genet harness compiled the exact provider and Knot adapter
  sources and passed eight admission, unavailability, erasure, retention,
  repin, and real-Djot tests; strict locked metadata also accepts the direct
  package dependency. The broad Turnstone workspace resolver did not reach
  `rustc`, so this is not a full-shell green receipt. Invocation, read-only,
  generic AccessKit projection, and that full-shell build remain explicit T0
  gates.
- 2026-08-25: Mere `709ae402` published the explicit read-only document
  posture. Edit, save, and direct mutable-input access refuse without changing
  the document or file; the retained component renders an inert document body
  with no save button, and the desktop host yields no writable text slot. An
  independent exact-source package mirror passed nine unit tests, including
  the DOM and file-immutability receipts.
- 2026-08-25: Turnstone `a37e6a1` published both file-choice commands and the
  atomic contributed-pane summon. The selected path and access posture persist
  in the versioned source, cancel is a no-op, and source admission is host-only.
  The exact current-Genet provider harness passed nine tests, including the
  read-only admission. A concurrent Cargo package-cache lock and the existing
  broad resolver prevented a full-shell compile from reaching `rustc`; generic
  AccessKit projection and that build receipt remain open T0 gates.
- 2026-08-26: Genet `b8de627` published retained document roles, read-only
  state, and distinct Focus and Click actions; `4e60f93` then excluded hidden
  nodes, retained live-region and disabled state, suppressed actions on
  disabled controls, and repaired focus fallback. Turnstone `0c105a7`
  published the generic contribution bridge: independent DOM ids are
  namespaced per pane, exact retained bounds are translated into window space,
  contributed subtrees join the same tree used by the OS adapter and scenario
  assertions, and Focus and Click route back to their original DOM nodes.
  The exact Genet source harness passed nine tests and the exact Turnstone
  composition harness passed three after exposing and correcting one type
  inference error. The broad workspace check again spent its bounded run in
  dependency resolution without reaching `rustc`; the full-shell build receipt
  therefore remains open rather than being inferred from the focused gates.
- 2026-08-26: Distillery's installed authority surface provides the independent
  P0 product half: `distillery.installed.v1` has a data-only descriptor and an
  erased Cambium session, rendering installed profile/protection, mesh-local
  paths, bound resident settings, and the exact latest `ResidentReceipt`. It
  adds no host abstraction, command, scheduler, device policy, or second
  resident model. P0 is not frozen: Turnstone still needs to register/admit
  this provider through its existing dynamic map and prove that no
  provider-specific renderer arm was added. The full-shell build remains open.
  An exact-source Distillery harness passed all
  five library tests, including the surface snapshot and exact receipt render;
  the installed configure/inspect binary check and package Clippy with warnings
  denied passed against the same integrated source graph.
- 2026-08-26: Turnstone `9d3a7d8` admits `distillery.installed.v1` — the P0
  second-provider proof. `DistilleryInstalledProvider` registers through the
  same `SurfaceProviderRegistry` as Knot and Sky with no Distillery-specific
  renderer arm; its versioned source carries only installed-bootstrap
  projection facts (profile, protection, mesh id, private paths, optional
  resident cadences), so a pane grant conveys projection, never Distillery
  authority. Malformed mesh ids, spinning cadences, and unknown payload
  versions are refused before admission. Receipts ran from a clean Turnstone
  worktree resolving the published mere pin with no local patch config: six
  provider tests (rendered projection, resident cadence round trip, generic
  AccessKit `Status` role), the seven existing contributed-surface registry
  tests, an all-targets check, and — closing the long-open gate — the full
  shell binary build reaching and completing `rustc`. The full lib suite
  passes 394 tests; its two failures (chrome_view document find, place lane
  partition heal) reproduce identically on `origin/main` without the change.
  P0's remaining step is the contract reduction and freeze.
- 2026-08-26: the pre-freeze census ran across Genet, mere, and Turnstone and
  is recorded as a finding above, with four open freeze decisions (F-1
  through F-4): unify or cut `accepted_source`, cut the unread descriptor
  tail, cut the three uncalled trait methods, and keep or trim the
  unavailable-reason set. The reduction itself waits on those rulings.
- 2026-08-26: F-1 ruled (unify), and the remaining decisions were scoped by
  tracing each item's intended consumer through the suite-composition
  census, the pane-registry plan, and the concrete-host call graph. The
  scoping flipped F-3's recommendation from cut to keep — the three
  methods erase real shipped host machinery — and surfaced the
  pointer-capture routing gap in Turnstone's contributed pane path. F-2
  through F-4 remain open for ruling.
- 2026-08-26: all four decisions ruled (F-1 unify; F-2 cut all four; F-3
  keep all three; F-4 keep all eight) and the freeze landed. Genet
  `001448d55` reduces the descriptor to identity, `label`, and
  `accepted_source`, documents `accepted_source` as the admission truth,
  keeps the fourteen-method trait, and stamps both modules frozen at v1
  (additive until a v2), with a Cambium changelog entry; `genet-host-api`
  21 and `cambium` 179 tests pass. Turnstone `3f63671` lands the F-1
  invariant: `SurfaceRegistrationError::SourceShapeMismatch` refuses a
  provider whose declared source kind disagrees with its admission
  schema, and all four provider suites pass against it. Follow-through
  rides the next Genet pin bumps: the descriptor literals in
  `knot-document`, `distillery`, Turnstone's Sky provider, and Turnstone's
  test fixtures drop the removed fields when each repo aligns past
  `001448d55`; the pointer-capture routing gap stays noted for the T lane.
  P0 is complete.

## 8. Final done conditions

- standalone Knot and Turnstone use the same Knot document model, intents, and
  Cambium component;
- a boxed retained session hides concrete product state and actions while
  preserving DOM, input, accessibility, automation, and lifecycle behavior;
- descriptors remain data-only, and commands/settings reuse their existing
  host contracts;
- Turnstone adds future port surfaces through registration and admission rather
  than provider-specific renderer branches;
- a second independent provider proves the seam before it is frozen;
- evidence, sharing, and resident status preserve their existing authority and
  custody boundaries;
- deferred broader product work remains explicit in this plan.
