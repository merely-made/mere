# Esp Consolidation Plan

**Date**: 2026-08-08
**Status**: E0-E4 complete 2026-08-09. ESP 0.1.0, Vates 0.1.2, and Sibylla
0.1.2 are published on crates.io in that order. The 2026-08-08 adversarial
amendments remain authoritative: corrected knot consumer graph, restored
mesh/scheduler boundaries, host-side device policy, narrowed servitor
language, and separate portability and repository-promotion gates. Supersedes
the first draft written in `repos/esp/design_docs/` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->; that file is now a pointer
here. D2's configured embedding matrix and first exact browser decoder row now
pass, including cooperative token-boundary cancellation, explicit browser
device teardown, and exact recovery in a fresh worker. Physical GPU-allocation
release remains unobservable in Chromium. Immutable ModelSession plus the real
PEFT LoRA row are complete, and Eidetic's training/evaluation artifact boundary
has landed. The next model execution gate is one deterministic local trainer
fixture; communal compute remains later.
**Scope**: fold `vates` and `sibylla` into one crate named `esp` inside mere,
retire the two names, and connect the crate to the intention corpus it serves.
The lanes themselves keep their own plans; this doc consolidates the code and
holds the ledger, it does not absorb the lanes.

**Related (the corpus this reconnects):**

- [burn_utilization_brief](../research/2026-07-04_burn_utilization_brief.md) —
  the five endorsed lanes; the spine of §4.
- [local_models_harness_brief](../research/2026-06-24_local_models_harness_brief.md)
  — the runtime + harness layer; its §7 "where the seam crate lives" question is
  answered by this plan: the seam crate is esp.
- [geist_models_brief](../research/2026-05-10_geist_models_brief.md) — geist =

## 1. Decisions (registered 2026-08-08)

1. **esp lives in mere**, at `crates/intel/esp`, publishing from mere exactly as
   vates and sibylla do today. This follows the 2026-07-23 repo consolidation
   rather than reversing it; `repos/esp` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> stays as the name-reservation repo and
   a pointer. Promote out later if and only if a consumer outside mere
   materializes (§5 names the triggers).
2. **One crate, two namespaces**: `esp::infer` (vates, 14 files) and
   `esp::embed` (sibylla, 24 files). Both crates already default to serde-only
   and wasm-clean with every heavy backend behind features, so the wall the two
   crates enforced is one features already enforce. Feature names carry over
   unchanged (`actor`, `decoder`, `decoder-wgpu`; `index-burn`,
   `index-burn-wgpu`, `bert`, `bert-wgpu`, `bert-validation`); the near-duplicate
   dependency blocks (burn 0.21, tokenizers, safetensors, serde_json, the wasm
   getrandom override) merge into one.
3. Accepted cost: independent versioning between the halves goes away. Fine at
   0.1.x with one owner; revisit only for a real external consumer on a
   different cadence.

## 2. The consumer graph (verified, and why this is small)

`vates` ← `mere-infer` only. `sibylla` ← `mere-embed` **and `ports/knot` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->**
(`sibylla.workspace = true`, knot:51). `mere-embed` ← `eidetic-search` only.
**`mere-infer` ← nobody**: it exists to re-export vates under `infer::` paths,
nothing imports it, and its only original content is one integration test.
Nothing outside the mere repository consumes any of them; isometry, the named
flagship in both founding proposals, never wired either.

Method note, learned the hard way: the first draft said "sibylla ← mere-embed
only" because its dependency grep matched `name = {...}` but not the dotted
`name.workspace = true` form knot uses. Consumer graphs get verified with
`cargo metadata` (or a grep matching both forms), never a single-form grep.
The same bug undercounted servitor's consumers (six, not four: commons-spine,
document-host, gemot, knot, turnstone, cleromancy).

Two side-findings the consolidation collects:

- Retiring `mere-infer` resolves a live name collision: `register-viewer` and
  `graph-kernel` depend on the crates.io `infer` crate (file-type detection)
  while the workspace aliases `infer` to `mere-infer`. Afterward the bare word
  means one thing.
- The DOC_README entry for the
  [intel_vector_index_burn_lift_plan](2026-07-06_intel_vector_index_burn_lift_plan.md)
  still says "scoped, not started"; the lift re-homed into sibylla at its
  founding and landed there (sibylla's `index_burn`, keyed accelerators,
  measured crossover). Worth a line-item correction when this plan executes.

## 3. Consolidation phases

- **E0 — skeleton plus the feature/target matrix.** `crates/intel/esp` with
  the two namespaces, the merged dependency block, the union of the feature
  sets. An empty compile proves too little; E0's done-condition is a recorded
  matrix: empty/default on native and wasm; every feature individually;
  infer × embed combinations; the tokenizer question decided (both halves pin
  `onig`, native Oniguruma, so the wasm story needs tokenizers' wasm-compatible
  regex path or an honest wasm exclusion per feature); `decoder-wgpu` made to
  activate the wasm `getrandom` override it currently misses in the merged
  manifest; CPU-vs-real-wgpu parity smoke; and confirmation the default tree
  pulls neither burn nor tokenizers. Prior wasm receipts are treated as
  historical until re-run here.
- **E1 — move sibylla in.** `mere-embed` drops its path dep and rides
  `esp::embed`, keeping its genuine glue (persistence, quint field bridge,
  canvas search) mere-side per sibylla's founding split. **Repoint knot too**
  (its direct `sibylla` dep). Verify with `eidetic-search` under `bert` +
  `bert-wgpu`, and knot's own tests.
- **E2 — move vates in; delete `mere-infer`.** Not repointed, removed. Its
  `eidetic_corridor` test moves beside the other mere-side corridor tests
  first. One naming fix while everything is in motion: vates's `canned` and
  sibylla's `stub` are the same idea; `stub` wins (sibylla already renamed away
  from `hashed` once for honesty; keep that direction).
- **E3 — workspace and doc sweep.** Remove `infer`, add `esp`, and remove all
  active consumers of `vates` and `sibylla`; their workspace keys remain only
  to build the E4 compatibility shims. The intel cluster keeps its directory
  name. Sweep the record in the same pass: mere's root README, DOC_README
  (including the stale "scoped, not started" line on the index burn lift, §2),
  supersession banners on the two founding proposals, package metadata, and
   the `repos/esp` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> pointer.
- **E4 — publish esp, then compatibility shims.** Order matters because
  published versions are permanent: `esp` 0.1.0 first, then final `vates` and
  `sibylla` releases that depend on esp and re-export their old APIs with
  `#[deprecated]` markers (`CannedProvider` kept as a deprecated alias of the
  renamed stub). A notice-only tombstone is easy to miss and crates.io shows
  no maintenance badge; the shim keeps any stray consumer compiling and
  pointing at the door. Cost accepted: the shims pin an esp version and ride
  along on future bumps.

Risks carry from the draft: mere's workspace manifest is the likeliest
concurrent-work conflict, so E1 and E2 land as separate commits with targeted
per-crate tests; the wgpu features need a real device to verify and
`eidetic-search` turns both on.

## 4. The intention ledger (what esp is the seam FOR)

The consolidation above covers only what lanes 1, 3, and 5 already landed. The
corpus records considerably more, endorsed and unclaimed. esp is the named home
for the seams all of it rides; each lane spins out to its own plan when picked
up, per the burn brief's own rule.

**Landed, inherited by esp:**

- Lane 1: burn-wgpu on, measured (BERT 3.2-38x GPU; field eval CPU-default;
  the burn existing-device init seam verified).
- Lane 3 core: the `InferenceProvider` seam, the streaming actor with
  mid-stream cancellation, the own llama-family decoder validated on TinyLlama
  (9.95 tok/s wgpu vs 0.09 CPU), eidetic `ManifestId` loading.
- Lane 5: the burn-free solver and affinity seams into gyre, blended affinity,
  lexical embedding, all with the honest in-context numbers.
- The vector-index Burn lift (now in `esp::embed`, exact, measured crossover).

**Unfinished, with esp as the seam home:**

- **Lane 3's tail**: the `endpoint` backend (external OpenAI-compatible
  endpoints; named in vates's manifest as roadmap), the wasm half of the
  done-condition, and D2 (the empirical wasm model-size ceiling, which sets
  the in-browser tier). D2 now has its own
  [headed-browser probe plan](2026-08-09_browser_model_ceiling_probe_plan.md).
  It is a measurement list, not one number, per the
  WebLLM lesson: cold download, warm reopen, artifact integrity,
  persistent-storage status, first-token latency, steady throughput, GPU
  memory, cancellation, UI frame impact, worker restart. Model artifacts ride
  the existing muniment IndexedDB store and its headed-proven persistence
  status UX (graphshell's 2026-08-06 browser-storage receipt); esp does not
  grow its own cache. The configured embedding matrix and first real decoder
  row now pass in headed Chromium. Cooperative decoder cancellation stops
  before the next fragment crosses the worker boundary; the host then calls
  `GPUDevice.destroy()`, terminates the worker, and reproduces the exact output
  in a fresh worker. The remaining D2 tail is physical GPU-allocation telemetry
  and larger capability bounds only when a consumer forces them.
- **The harness's model-session tail (landed 2026-08-24)**: `AdapterLoader`,
  typed `ModelAdapterManifest`, and immutable `ModelSession` now bind the exact
  base manifest, tokenizer, prompt template, quantization, loader, and ordered
  adapter set before execution. ESP rejects artifact hashes, PEFT version,
  base, loader, capability, template, and quantization mismatches rather than
  guessing. The first real PEFT LoRA row applies all 120 q/k/v/o tensors from a
  pinned SmolLM2 adapter and matches an independent full-checkpoint merge at
  all 49,152 next-token logits. The provider remains the streaming execution
  contract, and session loading creates a private tensor set rather than
  mutating provider-global adapter state. A real stacked-adapter row remains
  consumer-gated; training stays Lane 4.
- **Lane 2, the personal mesh**: the split honors the standing
  resource-coordination boundaries rather than reinventing them.
  `crates/mesh/mesh` already owns the signed M1 job grammar and Echo/Blake3
  jobs over LogSync; `JobSpec`, enforced `JobNamespace`, and the
  `MeshResource` registry are the active M2 slice. The lease/scheduler plan
  owns owner priority, revocable
  leases, heartbeats, checkpoint classes, device policy, and owner reclaim.
  So: **esp** = model loading, tensor ops, the local/remote compute adapter,
  cooperative cancellation points; **mesh** = job grammar, namespace, resource
  registry, lease lifecycle, checkpoint/result facts; **host scheduler** =
  foreground priority, device selection, render-vs-compute budget, reclaim;
  **murm** = the shared iroh endpoint and Router; **servitor::Gate** = whether
  an admitted denizen may petition the graph at all. Burn's `PeerAuthorizer`
  is session admission, not job authorization; the opaque credential it checks
  may carry a mesh lease reference, but mesh enforces scope, expiry, and
  reclaim locally. (This said `RemoteTicket` until 2026-08-10; no such type
  exists in `burn-remote 0.22.0-pre.1`.) **The first step needs no burn at all**: the revised M2 plan uses
  `esp::embed::LexicalEmbeddingProvider` for a useful deterministic batch;
  `StubEmbeddingProvider` remains a test double with meaningless similarity.
  The prerelease migration and lease-bound Burn Remote adapter have since
  landed. Distillery now mounts the literal Burn ALPN on its existing
  p2panda/Iroh endpoint, admits only a signed live-lease projection, and closes
  the exact session before owner reclaim is authored. A clean two-peer MiniLM
  receipt drives ESP over that adapter on native WGPU, interrupts an in-flight
  512-row request, then exactly recovers all 384 values under a new lease.
  Stable 0.22 publication remains the dependency repin gate, not an executable
  adapter gate. See the
  [migration plan](2026-08-09_burn_0_22_migration_plan.md) and
  [receipt](../testing/2026-08-23_distillery_remote_minilm_receipt.md).
- **Lane 4, training**: Distillery-as-trainer as a native-only armillary job
  over the scoped corpus, emitting the geist §6 engram triple
  (`ModelAdapterManifest` + `TrainingCorpus` + `EvalReport`); the bunsen
  group-optimizer borrow; done when an adapter measurably beats the untuned
  baseline on a recall or ranking task. Lane 2 turns the personal fleet into
  the training pool.
- **D1, the device policy**: now a three-consumer decision (netrender render,
  infer generation, embed affinity) with measured contention on the shared
  queue (a 200-token answer at >40s, coalesce to ~18s, well under the 9.95
  tok/s standalone). **esp does not own this.** One consumer must not own
  policy shared by rendering, inference, embedding, and later training: esp
  accepts a host-selected device and exposes cancellation/yield hooks; the
  host scheduler owns foreground priority and the render-vs-compute budget.
  M2 supplies a host-owned cancellation handle and stops after a fast lexical
  resource. M3 proves device policy and owner reclaim before any long-running,
  GPU, or remote resource. The broader render-versus-compute decision stays
  open until the resident-data consumer forces it.
- **Scope guard**: esp is the inference and embedding seam home, not a
  taxonomy of every intelligent operation. Woodshed's structured audio
  analysis is a third, provenance-bearing provider seam that stays
  woodshed-side until a second consumer proves it, per its own plan.

**The communal horizon (moots get the capability):**

- **Geist**: a moot's accumulated flora plus an inference primitive that thinks
  in its idiom; adapters are engrams, composable at inference across tiers
  (yours + this moot's + that co-membership's). esp provides the faculty;
  eidetic stores the weights; the geist brief owns architecture and governance,
  and its §10.2 privacy question (training data vs the right to be forgotten)
  is still the hardest open item in the whole lane.
- **Sharing dataweights and open models**: adapter engrams travel under the
  same three-axis envelope (privacy / provenance / trust) as any engram, and
  the commons profile already proves the replication substrate (multi-writer
  convergence answered 2026-07-26/27, property-tested; membership by gemot,
  authority by personae, capability checks by servitor). Flora training data
  and trained adapters ride the same rails.
- **Group-scale compute, honestly bounded**: the communal-compute brief's
  verdict stands — hosting a big model communally is reachable now for async
  work; WAN *training* is demonstrated to 32B but only on curated nodes; the
  inference ladder is route-first, shard-last. "Run a bigger model than one
  machine can, as a group, asynchronously" is therefore a real target with a
  researched shape, and it composes from Lane 2 + the marketplace mechanics
  (tessera-shaped credit, T0-T3 verification) that the resource-coordination
  briefs own.

**The consumer shape.** The servitor crate is a headless identity, capability,
and petition gate (six consumers: commons-spine, document-host, gemot, knot,
turnstone, cleromancy); it is not an inference runtime, and this plan gives it
no new role. The composition is the point: an admitted denizen may be hosted
by armillary, use an esp model session, retain artifacts through eidetic, and
petition through `servitor::Gate`. The application host composes those organs;
none of them owns the resident. That composition is what "harnessing models"
completes into: not a chat box, a bounded resident with a scoped faculty. The
thoughtform words (servitor, tulpa, egregore) stay product language, not a
runtime type hierarchy.

**Sequence after E4:** steps 1 through 5 have executable prerelease receipts:
M2's versioned namespace and registry, M3's lease projection and owner reclaim,
the chosen Burn 0.22 prerelease migration, and Burn Remote as a Distillery
resource on the shared endpoint, followed by immutable ModelSession plus one
real adapter. Stable repinning remains release-gated. Lane 4 now has immutable
corpus and evaluation artifacts; the next model-facing step is the local
deterministic trainer receipt, not another session abstraction. Communal
compute follows only after that local receipt and portable checkpoints. D2's
headed-browser track remains independent evidence, now also the numerical
reference for the remote MiniLM forcing receipt.

## 5. Posture (does this necessitate going beyond mere?)

Not now, and the corpus is unambiguous about why: every unclaimed lane binds
into mere's substrate. Lane 2 rides murm's Router and tessera/kith; Lane 4
reads persona-scoped corpora and writes eidetic engrams; the communal lanes
ride gemot, personae, and the commons profile; the actors are armillary; the
resident is servitor. esp stays the portable burn boundary inside that weave,
publishing from mere.

Two valves, kept distinct because the consolidation ruling keeps them
distinct: portable crates may live in the platform repository and be consumed
from it, and the bar for a separate repository is coherent utility and
identity apart from mere and its products. So a **second consumer** (isometry
finally wiring the NPC lane, the graphshell remote lens needing client-side
inference) triggers *portability discipline*: portability tests, a documented
API and target support, semantic-version care. **Repository promotion**
requires independent ownership or release cadence, which no named consumer
implies. If the halves ever diverge, the intermediate is `esp-infer` +
`esp-embed` packages behind an `esp` facade, still inside mere.

## 6. Progress

- **2026-08-08**: first draft written standalone in `repos/esp` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->; Mark ruled esp
  lives in mere, one crate, `esp::infer` + `esp::embed` accepted, and asked for
  the plan to reconnect to the research corpus and for servitor's place in it.
  This version does both; the standalone draft is now a pointer. Consumer graph
  verified against manifests; corpus read (burn brief, harness brief, geist,
  communal compute, engram commons, commons profile). Nothing executed; E0 is
  the next act.
- **2026-08-08, review pass**: an adversarial review by a second agent landed
  seven corrections, all verified against the tree before adoption: knot's
  direct sibylla dep (the draft's grep missed dotted `workspace = true` deps;
  method note in §2), servitor at six consumers, the mesh/scheduler ownership
  boundaries restored to Lane 2 (with the M2 deterministic-embedding first
  step, which un-blocks Lane 2 from the burn release gate), device policy
  moved to the host scheduler, the servitor paragraph narrowed to composition
  language, portability separated from repository promotion, the E0 matrix,
  and the E4 esp-first publish order with compatibility shims. The review's
  burn 0.22.0-pre.1 status and prior-art lessons (WebLLM, mistral.rs,
  woodshed's scope guard) are folded into the ledger.
- **2026-08-09, E0-E3 implementation**: created `crates/intel/esp` with
  `esp::infer` and `esp::embed`; moved both implementation and test suites;
  renamed `CannedProvider` to `StubInferenceProvider` with a deprecated shim
  alias; removed `mere-infer`; repointed `mere-embed` and knot; retained
  Vates/Sibylla as deprecated compatibility crates; and swept the authority
  docs plus the standalone pointer repository. The recorded target matrix is
  `design_docs/intel_docs/technical_architecture/2026-08-09_feature_target_matrix.md`. Empty,
  every individual feature, combined CPU features, and combined browser-WGPU
  features compile on their claimed targets; the merged CPU suite passed 171
  tests with one ignored, the Eidetic corridor passed, and three real-device
  WGPU parity tests passed. ESP packages and verifies as 0.1.0. The shims pass
  all-feature workspace checks and package-file enumeration, then stop at the
  intended registry gate because ESP 0.1.0 has not been published. Knot's
  consumer compiled before concurrent publication-client work introduced an
  unrelated temporary-borrow error in its test module; that work was preserved
  untouched. That was the final local boundary before publication.
- **2026-08-09, E4 publication**: committed the consolidation as `1283b4a8`
  and published from a clean detached worktree at that commit. ESP 0.1.0
  packaged, verified, uploaded, and became available first. Vates 0.1.2 then
  resolved ESP from the registry, packaged, verified, and published; Sibylla
  0.1.2 followed with the same registry-backed verification. E0-E4 are
  complete.
- **2026-08-09, ledger spin-out**: kept this consolidation plan closed and
  moved its ready work into authorities of their own. M2 now owns versioned
  job wire, a host-enforced namespace, one resource registry, and a lexical
  ESP receipt. M3 separates deterministic lease facts from time-indexed
  projection and host reclaim. D2 has a headed-browser artifact/worker/ceiling
  probe. Burn 0.22 has a stable-release-gated migration matrix plus an optional
  disposable prerelease probe. Endpoint, model-session/adapter, training, and
  communal lanes remain entrance-gated rather than being smuggled into those
  scopes.
- **2026-08-21, D2 first headed row**: Distillery now hosts the independent
  browser evidence surface. The MiniLM artifact, integrity, IndexedDB reopen,
  copy ladder, worker termination, and warm restart passed. ESP's async BERT
  path reached BrowserWebGpu execution, but CubeCL emitted invalid
  max-reduction WGSL and the returned vector failed the committed MiniLM
  fixture. This is a measured Burn/CubeCL browser ceiling, not completion of
  ESP's wasm execution tail. D2c and decoder cancellation remain unopened.
- **2026-08-22, D2 embedding recovery and matrix**: the Cubek infinity
  materialization and Burn/CubeCL same-allocation binary-input fixes recovered
  fixture-valid MiniLM. Distillery then ran a four-row headed embedding matrix
  from 34.8 MB F16 BGE Micro through 438.0 MB F32 E5-base. All cold and warm
  rows passed integrity, numerical-reference, repeatability, WebGPU-error, and
  worker-cutoff gates. ESP's loader now promotes F16 safetensors weights to f32.
  This closes the embedding phase through the configured matrix; decoder
  streaming, cooperative cancellation, GPU-memory release, and the upper
  embedding boundary remain open.
- **2026-08-22, D2 first decoder row**: Distillery pinned a real
  SmolLM2-135M-Instruct checkpoint and an independent Transformers reference.
  That comparison corrected ESP's rotary pairing to Llama's split-half rule;
  the headed wasm run then forced an async token-readback path because browser
  WebGPU cannot block on Burn tensor data. Transformers CPU, ESP NdArray, and
  a clean Chromium 151 BrowserWebGpu build now emit the same eight ids and
  text. Cold/warm integrity reopen, repeatability, stream delivery, first-token
  and steady-token timing, frame sampling, and WebGPU error gates pass.
  Larger decoder bounds remain consumer-gated. Cooperative cancellation and
  host-controlled device teardown are proven below; physical GPU-memory release
  remains unavailable as browser telemetry.
- **2026-08-22, D2 decoder lifecycle**: ESP now checks a host cancellation flag
  after async token readback and before the next token crosses its observer
  boundary. A clean `45327c30` Chromium 151 receipt emitted one fragment,
  acknowledged cancellation, emitted zero later fragments, and returned a
  one-token partial result marked cooperatively cancelled. The worker then
  called `GPUDevice.destroy()` on its one tracked device with no errors,
  terminated with no messages in the 300 ms quiet window, and a fresh worker
  reopened the same manifest and reproduced the eight-token Transformers
  reference exactly. All GPU error scopes were empty. Browser allocation
  telemetry remains unavailable, so physical GPU-memory release is not claimed.
- **2026-08-23, remote MiniLM forcing consumer**: a clean Distillery fixture
  loaded ESP's pinned MiniLM through an authorized Burn Remote device between
  two distinct p2panda/Iroh peers and executed it on native WGPU. The 384-value
  output stayed within `1.4901161e-7` of ESP's native control and
  `1.4156103e-7` of the BrowserWebGpu reference prefix. Owner reclaim
  interrupted a live 512-row request, closed the only session before the
  reclaim fact, and a new epoch/session reproduced all values exactly. Plain
  WGPU passes. The follow-up measures 101 live CubeCL allocations and
  90,261,504 bytes during each run, returning exactly to the zero baseline
  before both reclaim facts. The later driver receipt measures 604,114,944 and
  637,603,840 dedicated bytes released, zero retained growth across reclaim
  baselines, NVIDIA GPU 0 attribution, and counter disappearance after process
  exit. A fresh-process feature matrix passes all local profiles and remote
  plain; optional Fusion and autotune profiles remain remote-unsafe through
  distinct load, timing, and cleanup failures rather than the old unbounded
  panic-hang.
- **2026-08-24, immutable model session and real adapter**: Eidetic gained a
  typed compatibility-bound `ModelAdapterManifest`; ESP gained content-addressed
  `ModelSession`, prepared requests, `AdapterLoader`, and an ordinary PEFT LoRA
  loader for llama-family q/k/v/o projections. A clean `aa121f03` Distillery
  receipt round-tripped every artifact through Eidetic, rejected a template
  mismatch before execution, changed the base result, and matched an
  independent CPU merge at all 49,152 logits with `0.0` maximum error. The
  adapter repository's published `merged_model.safetensors` was audited and is
  effectively the base checkpoint, so it is recorded as an invalid reference
  rather than used as the oracle. See the
  [receipt](../testing/2026-08-24_model_session_peft_lora_receipt.md).
- **2026-08-25, remote allocator and feature sidequests**: Burn Remote now
  acknowledges session closure after the worker has synced, dropped its
  interpreter, and run backend cleanup. Draining sessions remain visible and
  worker failure propagates through Distillery, preventing false reclaim
  receipts. Plain remote MiniLM returns CubeCL's 101 allocations and 90,261,504
  live bytes to zero across first reclaim and fresh-session recovery. The
  bounded matrix passes every local feature profile and remote plain. Remote
  Fusion plus autotune retains five allocations; the split remote Fusion and
  autotune profiles remain timing/load unsafe. Plain WGPU remains the supported
  profile. A clean Windows per-PID driver-memory receipt now closes physical
  allocation release for that plain profile while leaving optional remote
  Fusion/autotune unclaimed.
- **2026-08-26, Lane 4 artifact foundation**: Eidetic now owns the typed,
  immutable `TrainingCorpus` and `EvalReport` artifacts the Lane 4 triple
  named. The corpus has canonically ordered, non-empty, disjoint training and
  held-out evaluation partitions; the report is only a fixed-corpus,
  integer-counted `RecallAt` or `RankingAt` comparison of the declared base
  and adapter, with full adapter validation plus corpus-provenance validation.
  This adds neither tensor execution to Eidetic nor a
  training resource to ESP or Mesh. The next forcing act is one local,
  deterministic baseline-versus-adapter receipt; its actual resource seam and
  trainer choice remain uncommitted until then.
