# xilem-serval control-set adoption

**Date**: 2026-06-25
**Status**: P1 + P2 done 2026-06-25 (genet + meerkat). P3 gated/open. From the
[genet capability-misuse sweep](../../archive_docs/2026-07-03_completed_plans/2026-06-25_overlay_primitive_adoption_plan.md) (2026-06-25).
**Owner**: meerkat (consumes xilem-serval `controls`); P1/P2 also touch genet (xilem-serval +
genet-render).

## Problem

`xilem-serval` exports a full reusable control set (`button`, `checkbox`, `toggle`, `radio_group`,
`select`, `slider`, `text_field` in `controls.rs` / `radio.rs` / `select.rs` / `slider.rs`). meerkat uses
exactly one of them, `text_field` (correctly, for the omnibar / palette / find / comms fields). Every other
control is hand-built from `div`s + an active CSS class, which also omits the ARIA roles the primitives
stamp. The a11y bridge already ignores stamped ARIA per the grand audit (`grand_audit.md:94`), so the
host hand-rolled rows have no role/state for a screen reader.

Specifics:
- **`button`** — 15 chrome buttons in [views.rs](../../../crates/meerkat/src/views.rs) *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-link --> hand-roll
  `on_click(el("button", label), handler)`, which is verbatim what `xilem_serval::button` wraps
  (`controls.rs:685`, whose own doc says it is "the ergonomic form of" that pattern).
- **`radio_group`** — every single-selection settings picker (node Face, theme Harmony, body/code font,
  orrery Layout, gloss lens, crawl Scope/Depth/Page-cap) is a list of `PaneItem::button` rows with the
  chosen one carrying `app-btn-active` + a check glyph. A radio group, minus `role="radio"`/`aria-checked`.
- **`checkbox`/`toggle`** — engine on/off and orrery/crawl boolean switches are buttons toggling
  `app-btn-active` (the host closures are even named `toggle`). No switch/checkbox role.

## The structural obstacle

meerkat's `PaneItem` model is deliberately **state-decoupled**: a row carries a string activation key the
host drains (`PaneItem::button(class, text, key)`), it does not bind a lensed `&mut RadioGroup` / `&mut
bool`. The xilem-serval primitives flip lensed state. So `radio_group` / `toggle` / `checkbox` do not drop
in without an adapter. This is why these are **underuse, not misuse**. `button` is the exception (it is
stateless, a near drop-in).

## Plan

**P1 — `button` adoption (near drop-in).**
- Replace the 15 `on_click(el("button", ...), h)` sites with `xilem_serval::button(label, h)`, keeping the
  `.attr("class", ...)` on the returned view. Confirm the class-on-button path works; if not, extend
  `button` to take a class or wrap once locally.
- Done: no bare `el("button")` in views.rs; one helper.

**P2 — ARIA stamping on the picker/toggle rows (the bankable a11y win).**
- The immediate value is not the lensing but the role/state the primitives emit. Two routes:
  (a) add `role="radio"` + `aria-checked` (and `role="switch"`/`aria-checked` for toggles) directly to the
  `PaneItem` rows that represent radio groups / switches, via a `PaneItem` variant or an attr pass; or
  (b) a thin adapter that renders `radio_group` / `toggle` driven by the PaneItem's selected index / bool
  while still emitting the host's activation key.
- Coordinate with the a11y bridge so the stamped ARIA is actually surfaced (the grand audit notes it is
  currently dropped).
- Done: settings pickers expose `role="radio"`/`aria-checked`; toggles expose switch semantics; a screen
  reader reads the selection.

**P3 — evaluate full primitive adoption (gated).**
- If a lensed `PaneItem` path emerges (or settings panes move off the key-drain model), adopt
  `radio_group` / `toggle` / `checkbox` directly and delete the hand-rolled class-toggle code.

## Non-goals (verified, do not force-fit)

- **`select`** — no natural consumer. The omnibar suggestions list is a richer autocomplete; the engine/
  face/layout pickers are intentionally context-menu / settings-pane rows, not form selects.
- **`slider`** — meerkat's `PaneItem` segmented slider is a discrete cell-picker with a hue-rainbow mode,
  a genuinely different widget from the continuous drag `slider`. Keep it.

## Progress

- 2026-06-25: Drafted from the capability sweep. Not started.
- 2026-06-25: **P1 done.** `.attr` was `El`-only (not on `OnClick`/`ElementView`), so the
  `button(..).attr("class", ..)` route did not compile as drafted. Resolved by extending genet:
  added a fluent `OnClick::attr` that forwards to the wrapped `El` (xilem-serval `event.rs`), so
  `xilem_serval::button(label, h).attr("class", x)` (and any attribute) now works, with a unit test
  (`button_attr_stamps_class_and_keeps_handler`). meerkat `views.rs` gained one `button(label, class,
  handler)` helper over `xilem_serval::button`; all 16 chrome button sites (the plan's 15 plus the
  newer knot-editor close) now route through it. No bare `el("button")` left. The `<button>` tag
  stamps `role="button"` for the a11y tree. `cargo check -p meerkat` clean; 87 meerkat lib tests +
  the xilem-serval button tests green (the 13-`<button>` toolbar count assertion still holds).
- 2026-06-25: **P2 genet-render half done (the prerequisite).** `genet-render/a11y.rs` now reads
  ARIA: `role_for` honors an explicit `role` attr (`button`/`checkbox`/`radio`/`radiogroup`/`switch`),
  overriding the tag, and `build` maps `aria-checked` (`true`/`false`/`mixed`) to accesskit `Toggled`.
  This is grand_audit direction 2 — previously the reader mapped roles by tag only and dropped the
  ARIA the controls already stamp, so any meerkat stamping would have been inert. Test
  `aria_role_and_checked_reach_the_tree` added; 3 a11y tests green. **Remaining P2 = the meerkat
  stamping half** (settings pickers/toggles).
- 2026-06-25: **P2 meerkat stamping half done.** `PaneItem` gained a `PaneAria` field +
  `PaneItem::radio(selected, ..)` / `switch(on, ..)` constructors (`list_pane.rs`); both render paths
  (`list_pane_view`, settings `item_view`) emit `role` + `aria-checked` from it. Every single-select
  picker is now a radio group and every boolean a switch, classified by actual selection semantics:
  **radio** — node Face + Engine-pin (`settings_node.rs`), theme picker (`apparatus.rs`), Harmony +
  body/code font + orrery Layout + importance-metric + bridge-metric + Gloss-lens + crawl
  Scope/Depth/Page-cap (`settings_lane.rs`); **switch** — engine on/off (`apparatus.rs`), the
  link-arrows / orrery size-by / rings / gloss-scope / gloss-size / affinity / mirror booleans, and
  crawl sitemap (`settings_lane.rs`). Stateless action rows (shape/size/material steppers, scenes, scripts, physics,
  tab-cap, theme fork/mode/remove) stay plain buttons. Test `radio_and_switch_items_stamp_aria` added;
  `cargo check -p meerkat` clean, 87 lib + 160 bin tests green. **Deferred:** the `role="radiogroup"`
  container — the flat `Vec<PaneItem>` model has no group boundaries, so wrapping each picker would need
  group structure in the item stream; the radio rows announce + read their checked state without it
  (the P2 Done condition), so this is a later refinement. The menu-editor inclusion list (reorder rows
  with ✓) and the script-cap cycle buttons are left as-is (neither is a radio/switch).
