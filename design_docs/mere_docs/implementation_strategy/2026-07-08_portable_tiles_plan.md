# Portable tiles: cross-window DOM identity (design step 4)

**Date**: 2026-07-08
**Status (2026-10-06):** no slice landed here, and the consumer it was written
for is gone: this plan was the meerkat consumer, and meerkat was removed
2026-07-18 (`c5f01064`). Step 3 no longer blocks it: the
[forest_dom_plan](../../archive_docs/2026-08-06_completed_plans/2026-07-08_forest_dom_plan.md)
landed 2026-07-18, and its topology is live as Cambium's
`GenetMultiRunner::push_forest_projection`
(`crates/cambium/cambium/src/multi.rs:132`), used by cambium-rootstock and
Turnstone; only genet-layout's `ForestDom` spike was retired (genet
`55c05d11759`). P0's outcome is delivered by Turnstone's tear-out
(`TearOutActivePane`, `turnstone:src/action.rs:233-238`; `tear_out_tile` at
`turnstone:src/app/pane_arms.rs:345`, with member-keyed content sessions at
`turnstone:src/shell/lens.rs:232-250`). Open: P1 and P2, unblocked and unbuilt.
**Parent**: [one_state_n_windows_design](../design/2026-07-05_one_state_n_windows_design.md)
— **step 4** (§8), the mechanism in §5, the trichotomy in §6.
**Genet dependency (LANDED)**: the moveBefore engine
([genet movebefore plan](../../../../genet/docs/2026-07-05_movebefore_dom_standard_plan.md),
S1–S5): the `PortableKeyed` View wrapper, the `Moved` mutation, the ctx **nursery** (parks a
departing keyed subtree until the target adopts it), and `(node, path)` handler
reconciliation. A cross-parent keyed move already preserves element + DOM node + view state
+ live handlers with one atomic `Moved`. This plan is the **meerkat consumer** of that.

**Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** meerkat was removed 2026-07-18
(`c5f01064`), and with it the pelt `TileShell` and `WindowView` bookkeeping
that the lane split below describes. `PortableKeyed` and the nursery survive
in Cambium (`crates/cambium/cambium/src/context.rs`, lines 126 and 244), and
`crates/cambium/cambium/src/frisket.rs:39` keys `Slot::View` tiles by `TileId`.

**Gesture source**: [tearout_gestures_plan](2026-06-24_tearout_gestures_plan.md) owns the
user-facing tear-out gestures (drag = leaf, Shift = branch, Ctrl+Shift = fork — the *graph
scope* axis); this plan owns what happens to the tile's *DOM identity* when a gesture moves
it. The two axes are orthogonal.

## What "done" is (design §8 step 4)

Dragging a tile to another window preserves its DOM node (same `NodeId`), its scroll position
observably survives, the target window's apply is scoped rather than a full recompute, and the
§6 trichotomy is expressed as plain state mutations. The genet half is done; the meerkat half
is the below.

## The first question, and it is load-bearing: which content is even DOM-lane?

The design models a tile as a **keyed DOM subtree** the forest diff moves. meerkat's content
is split across two lanes, and only one is DOM:

- **DOM-lane** (shell document subtrees): the folded panes (roster, gloss outline/recent/
  minimap-nodes, list panes, settings tiles) and the document-lane focus cards. These *are*
  `ScriptedDom` subtrees under the window root, so `PortableKeyed` + a cross-window
  `move_before` applies directly. Scroll, text buffers, focus, a11y identity survive.
- **Surface-lane** (pelt + external texture): the **workbench content tiles** render through
  `WindowView.pelt_shell` (a pelt `TileShell` surface) and composite per-member **actor**
  textures (`tile_textures`), not shell DOM. Their *content* is window-agnostic already — the
  content actor is per-member and does not care which window composites its external texture —
  so a cross-window move of a workbench tile's *content* survives for free by reassigning the
  member's window, **without** the forest dom or moveBefore. What is NOT DOM here is the tile
  chrome (tab, frame), which pelt owns per surface.

So step 4 is not one mechanism but a **lane split**:
1. **DOM-lane tiles** move by `PortableKeyed` + `move_before` (needs the forest dom).
2. **Surface-lane tiles** move by **member→window reassignment** (the actor re-composites in
   the target; needs no forest dom). The scroll offset is the one host-side bit to carry
   (below).

Reconciling this with the design's single "keyed subtree" model is the first thing to settle:
either the workbench migrates into the shell DOM (a much larger change, probably not worth it),
or step 4 is explicitly the two-lane story above (recommended: it matches the built
architecture and keeps the forest dom's blast radius to the DOM-lane content).

## The §6 trichotomy as state operations (both lanes)

Once a tile is portable, the three modes fall out of state mutations plus the ordinary rebuild,
with no per-gesture wiring:

- **Leaf-move**: the tile's window assignment changes in `AppState` (which `WindowLocal` owns
  it). DOM-lane: the forest diff moves the keyed subtree A-root → B-root; the nursery preserves
  it. Surface-lane: the member's window reassigns; the actor composites in B.
- **Sticky-note**: state grows a note object where the tile was; both windows' lenses render
  the same truth (a synced panel, which is free under one state).
- **Rekey**: the tile's binding changes. Same key + new binding keeps the element and swaps its
  content; a deliberate new key is a deliberate rebuild.

## The host-side state that must follow the move (OQ-4)

The DOM move (or the actor reassignment) does not carry meerkat's per-window `WindowView`
bookkeeping. Of it:

- **`view.scroll[member]` must follow the tile** — else a torn-out tile jumps to the top in its
  new window. This is the one genuinely load-bearing carry.
- **`tile_rects` self-heal** (recomputed every frame) — nothing to carry.
- **`tile_textures[member]`** is a perf cache — rebuild in the target, or hand it over for a
  frame-perfect handoff (a nicety, not correctness).

## The middle path (#1): portability without the forest dom

Recorded because it is a real option and the gate on step 3 may keep the forest dom out for a
while (see the [forest_dom_plan](../../archive_docs/2026-08-06_completed_plans/2026-07-08_forest_dom_plan.md) gate, where this is the third
option between fresh-build and the full forest dom):

- **Surface-lane tiles already have it** — member→window reassignment needs no forest dom, so a
  torn-out *content* tile keeps its live page + (with the scroll carry) its scroll position
  today, on N doms. This is most of what a user feels when they tear out a web tile.
- **DOM-lane tiles** cannot keep DOM-node identity across N doms (per-arena `NodeId`s;
  `move_before` throws cross-document). The ceiling on N doms (design §3) is a **new cross-tree
  key registry** carrying *view-side* retained state only: a keyed component's internal state
  survives, but the DOM node, scroll, text buffer, and layout rebuild fresh in the target.
- **Recommendation**: do NOT build the cross-tree key registry speculatively. It is a distinct
  new mechanism (a cross-*document* state carrier, not the same-document nursery genet already
  has), and for the content that matters most (web tiles) the surface-lane path already
  preserves the live state. Build it only if a specific **view-heavy** DOM-lane tile (a
  stateful widget, not a web page) needs its state to survive a tear-out before the forest dom
  lands. Otherwise the forest dom is the better investment for the general DOM-lane case.

## Slices (after step 3, except P0)

- **P0 (now, no forest dom needed): surface-lane portability + the scroll carry.** Make a
  cross-window workbench-tile move reassign the member's window and carry `view.scroll[member]`.
  **Done when** a torn-out web tile keeps its live page and scroll position in the new window (a
  headed drive on mk-harness). This banks the felt payoff early and is independent of the forest
  dom.
- **P1 (needs step 3): DOM-lane tiles as `PortableKeyed` children.** Wrap the portable shell-DOM
  subtrees (start with settings tiles or a document-lane card) in `PortableKeyed` keyed by
  member. **Done when** a cross-window move of a DOM-lane tile keeps its `NodeId` + scroll, with
  the target apply scoped (not a full recompute), under test + a headed drive.
- **P2: the §6 trichotomy wired to the gestures.** The tear-out gesture (leaf/branch/fork) sets
  the tile's window assignment / note / rekey in `AppState`; the portable machinery lowers each
  to the right DOM operation. **Done when** all three modes produce the right survival behavior
  from state alone, no per-gesture DOM wiring.

## Risks / watch-items

- **The lane split is the design-vs-build reconciliation** — settle it (two-lane story vs
  workbench-into-DOM) before P1, or P1 chases a model meerkat does not have.
- **Blocked on the forest-dom gate.** P1/P2 cannot start until step 3 is committed; P0 can.

  **Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** the gate is passed. The forest dom
  landed 2026-07-18 and its topology is live as Cambium's
  `push_forest_projection` (see the status).
- **Do not over-build the middle path** (see recommendation) — it is a real option, not a
  default.
- **Scroll carry is the recurring load-bearing bit** across both lanes and both the middle path
  and the full path; get it right once (a `member → scroll` handoff on window reassignment) and
  reuse it.

## Progress

*(none yet — planning stage, downstream of the forest-dom gate. P0, the surface-lane scroll
carry, is the one slice that can start independently.)*

**Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** P0's outcome exists in Turnstone, not
here. Its `TearOutActivePane` keeps the pane's DOM, widget state and scroll
untouched by the move (`turnstone:src/action.rs:233-238`), with the branch arm
`TearOutTile` at `:476-480`.

- **2026-10-06 (S14 pass).** Status and claims corrected against the tree at
  mere 535bca11, from the D2 record in
  support/doc-audit/d2/batch_49_s14_phase_b11.md: the "blocked on step 3"
  status replaced (the forest dom landed and lives on as Cambium's forest
  projection), the meerkat consumer recorded as gone, and P0's outcome located
  in Turnstone's tear-out.
