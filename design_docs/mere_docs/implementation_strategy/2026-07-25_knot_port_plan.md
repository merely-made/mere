# Knot Port Plan

> **Repository note (2026-09-04):** Knot Editor is an independent repository,
> consumed by Djinn and Turnstone from one immutable revision; its sources left
> Mere under E2 of `knot-editor/design_docs/2026-09-01_knot_editor_repository_extraction_plan.md`,
> so the `ports/knot` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> paths below name the layout each receipt landed against.

**Date:** 2026-07-25
**Status:** implementation complete locally 2026-07-27. K0 through K7 are
executable. Knot has now pulled Stickleback's causal projection seam:
concurrent writers for one document are reported as a visible conflict while
unrelated documents remain available, and an explicit resolution names the
exact causal versions it replaces. Personal vault sync and communal
multi-member Knot are separate signed encryption profiles; communal documents
use retained Commons data-key epochs. Graphshell protocol 1.1 now carries the
payload-free revision bell Knot's native watcher needed. K7's Cambium text
primitive is committed on local Genet `main` at `44e291afe8b`; publishing that
commit remains the clean remote-checkout gate.

**Companions:** genet's
[pelt and knot direction](https://github.com/merely-made/genet/blob/main/docs/2026-07-24_pelt_knot_direction.md)
(the text-editing ruling and knot's destination) and its
[pelt port boundary](https://github.com/merely-made/genet/blob/main/docs/2026-07-24_pelt_port_boundary.md),
the [application prospects brief](../../2026-07-24_application_prospects_brief.md)
(the composition thesis this port instantiates), the
[shared-engram commons brief](../research/2026-07-24_shared_engram_commons_brief.md)
(knot as page content class and the settled convergence/key decisions), and the
[Graphshell remote projection host plan](2026-07-22_graphshell_remote_projection_host_plan.md)
(the protocol this port serves). The reconciled
[historical authoring and clipping plan](../../archive_docs/2026-08-06_completed_plans/2026-06-24_djot_editor_knot_nodes_plan.md),
the dedicated
[Knot authoring consumer plan](2026-07-27_knot_authoring_consumer_plan.md), and
evaluation/export plan (`genet/design_docs/archive_docs/2026-09-02/2026-06-12_knot_evaluation_export_plan.md`)
hold the remaining product-authoring, clipping, effect, consent, HTML, and cache
work. Those are follow-ons to this port's K0-K7 closure, not missing port
milestones.

## 1. Ruling

**Knot is a Mere port at `ports/knot` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path -->, beside `ports/graphshell`.** It ships a
host plus a `knot_endpoint` binary, the shape Turnstone and Isometry already
use and G4 already proved.

Not a standalone repository: it has no identity apart from Mere, consuming
chartulary, muniment, eidetic, stickleback, personae, and sibylla. A separate repo
means git dependencies back into `mere.git`, which is what the 2026-07-23
consolidation removed. Not a Genet port either: Genet's cone witness enforces
one-way direction, and Pelt's graph-free discipline is deliberate, so anything
carrying a vault and a graph is disqualified from living there.

A port is also the reversible choice, which is what an incubator wants. It can
be promoted into Turnstone as a pane, or spun out to its own repository if it
graduates into a product. Founding a repository intended to dissolve is the
expensive direction.

**Name:** plain `knot`, per Mark 2026-07-25, favoring brevity over the word
pool. The port shares its word with the document format (`.knot`,
`DjotKnotEngine`); accepted as livable ambiguity.

## 2. What it is

The second half of Turnstone, incubated behind a protocol boundary instead of
inside the app. Turnstone browses; Knot holds and authors. Five properties, from
the originating question of what a local-first alternative to Obsidian and
Anytype would take:

1. read files in place, unencrypted and unmoved;
2. seal a personal vault, with cheap analysis over it;
3. sync across devices over Stickleback and p2panda;
4. choose the format a document is saved as;
5. FOSS and moddable.

The endpoint shape earns four of these for free. `ProjectionSource`
implementations "authorize selection before they disclose a score or scene and
retain ownership of native source data", which is property 1 stated as a
protocol boundary. The vault key lives in the endpoint, so Turnstone mounts
disclosures without ever holding it, which is a better security shape than a
vault inside the app rather than merely a cheaper one.

## 3. Findings: verified stack survey, 2026-07-25

**Already built, reused as-is.**

- **Sync.** Stickleback is the promoted deduplicated core, not the messaging
  domain: `SyncedSpace` is a generic reconciling-log drain whose injected seam
  is an `accept` closure deciding whether a received operation counted. Direct
  exchange, Moot, and Mesh already ride it, so a Knot space is another
  `accept`, not a fork. `drop_io` carries plain and protected drop export with
  receipts and prune proofs. Transports are p2panda and Reticulum.
- **Vault.** personae carries `vault.rs`, `seal.rs`, `passphrase_root.rs`,
  `sealed_record_storage.rs`, `startup_unlock.rs`; eidetic-core has `seal.rs`
  and session-runtime has `engram_seal.rs`.
- **Analysis.** sibylla, `intel/embed`, and `eidetic-search`, all in-process.
  This is the argument against the alternative of bridging an existing notes
  app over MCP, which taxes every session with tool schemas; local embeddings
  over a sealed store cost nothing per session.
- **Storage.** muniment mandates no wire format (pluggable `Codec`, JSON and
  postcard shipped) over backends redb, fjall, zip, and memory.
- **Typing.** chartulary content classes are data, not code: a class is
  `class_id` plus required facets plus schema references, and an unknown class
  reads back as `Unknown` rather than erroring. Turnstone now exercises the
  substrate with built-in web-page and note profiles. Knot adopts it; no class
  registry belongs in this port.
- **Editing.** The former Meerkat readout stack now lives in Genet:
  `knot-editor-host` derives Illume highlights, outline/folds, and Nematic's
  `DjotKnotEngine` preview from one host-owned source buffer. Cambium and
  Genet/Parley now supply the shared edit, IME, selection, movement, and
  geometry primitives. K7 is integration, not a new editor core.
- **Boundary.** chirograph, -client, -endpoint, and -stdio, with the
  stdio carrier giving a child-process JSON boundary. The G4 receipt mounted
  Turnstone and Isometry sessions into one host with neither product in
  Graphshell's dependency graph.

**Previously missing, now filled.**

- **Disk lane.** `DirectorySource` now discovers a real
  folder, preserves identity across ordinary renames using the filesystem file
  id, keeps bodies/content absent, applies a configurable ignore policy, and
  refreshes on Graphshell snapshot/resume. `DirectoryWatcher` receives native
  recursive OS events and collapses each drained burst into one Servitor-gated,
  watcher-attributed journal transition. Its key is derived from the host
  identity; revoking its grant freezes the accepted directory revision while
  the endpoint keeps serving. A durable facet sidecar remains future storage
  work rather than disk-authoritative file content.
- **File/note classes are filled.** Knot now ships `knot.file` and `knot.note`
  as chartulary class data with Eidetic-compatible facet schemas. This was a
  missing item in the 2026-07-25 survey and is now K2's completed adoption.
- **Writers.** `AuthoredFile` now selects `.knot`, Markdown, Djot, or JSON
  codecs over Genet's Inker/Nematic document model. Untouched source files
  bypass the write path, caller-selected Save As is explicit, foreign formats
  reach a fixed point after one parse-write pass, and canonical `.knot`
  round-trips byte-exactly.

## 4. Gates

- ~~**Text editing blocks the editor half entirely.**~~ **Cleared
  2026-07-27.** Cambium now owns grapheme-correct selection, edit commands,
  composition, and bounded undo; Genet/Parley owns visual movement, affinity,
  hit-testing, and caret/selection geometry; `cambium-winit` supplies key and
  IME translation. Woodshed and Isometry exercise both host-routing shapes.
  Knot remains a consumer through `knot-editor-host`.
- ~~**The convergence decision has landed; Knot has not pulled it.**~~
  **Cleared 2026-07-27.** The
  [commons convergence plan](../../archive_docs/2026-08-06_completed_plans/2026-07-26_commons_multi_writer_convergence_plan.md)
  proves deterministic causal materialization over per-author logs. K5 now
  signs exact observed parents, restores author heads after Redb reopen, and
  returns documents, per-document conflicts, and pending-history diagnostics
  separately. Its compatibility `documents()` call still returns
  `ConcurrentWriter`; new consumers use the lossless projection. Knot also
  persists a Knot-native document/conflict snapshot plus digest and
  author-frontier checkpoint, and names the retained tail before pruning. A
  `Resolve` event can replace only named causal
  versions; it cannot erase an unseen concurrent edit. Communal Knot uses
  Stickleback's retained Commons data epochs, while the personal multi-device
  profile keeps its vault-derived seal key.
- ~~**Livery is the declared long pole.**~~ **Cleared 2026-07-27.** The Genet
  workspace build is green. Knot's remaining work is its own storage,
  authority, writer, and integration ladder.

## 5. Sequence

Done-conditions, not dates. Every rung is complete locally. Automatic
same-document text merge remains a Knot-owned product decision; the log now
has an explicit, causal resolution operation instead of a hidden
whole-document tiebreak.

- **K0. Port scaffold. Complete locally 2026-07-27.** `ports/knot` *(historical citation)* <!-- doc-audit: historical-path --> is a
  workspace member and `knot_endpoint` discloses a fixed fixture through the
  resumable stdio carrier. `g4_sessions` mounted it beside Turnstone and
  Isometry: four sessions from three endpoint processes. The committed receipt
  regenerated byte-identically.
- **K1a. Files-in-place projection. Complete locally 2026-07-27.**
  `DirectorySource` recursively indexes a caller-selected folder under a
  configurable ignore policy. Containers carry `file:` addresses, titles,
  media types, and facets while `body` and `content` stay absent. Native file
  identity preserves the container id and foreign facets across rename. A disk
  edit increments the projection revision and returns a replacement snapshot
  on the next resume.
- **K1b. Autonomous watcher and authority. Complete locally 2026-07-27.**
  The recursive native watcher acts
  autonomously under its own servitor identity: its journal ops carry
  attribution, and revoking its grant is the pause switch. The disk stays
  authoritative for file-backed containers; graph-side facets are
  journal-only, and body edits (once the editor exists) write through to the
  file, with the endpoint serializing the two writers it owns. Bulk churn
  (checkouts, sync tools) is debounced behind the existing ignore policy. Done
  when an OS event produces one attributed journal transition; revoking the
  watcher grant pauses observation without stopping the endpoint; and a burst
  collapses into one revision. Tests cover all three.
- **K2. File and note content classes. Complete locally 2026-07-27.**
  `knot.file` requires `file.document`; `knot.note` requires both
  `file.document` and `note.document`. Their schemas use the existing
  `SchemaFacetValidator` seam. Tests prove a known note admits, malformed known
  facets fail, and an unknown class remains inert and discoverable.
- **K3. Vault lane. Complete locally 2026-07-27.** Personae sealing lives
  inside the endpoint. Tests assert that stored bytes are sealed, lock drops
  decrypted state, a wrong key cannot reopen it, and Graphshell disclosures
  contain neither the key nor authored body.
- **K4. Analysis. Complete locally 2026-07-27.** A Sibylla index spans the
  disk and vault lanes. The vault
  lane's index is derived content and lives under the seal, because
  embeddings invert. Queries are served in-process by the unlocked endpoint
  under grants, so agents keep the cheap read path: one unlock at startup,
  zero marginal crypto per query, and selectivity is a grant scope rather
  than a second crypto tier (a denizen with a vault-scoped grant gets vault
  hits; one without gets disk hits only). Tests span both lanes, prove grant
  selectivity, assert sealed index bytes, and remove vault hits on lock.
- **K5. Sync. Complete locally 2026-07-27.** Knot supplies its own encrypted
  event grammar, admitted-device policy, store, and Stickleback `accept`
  closure. Two memory-backed instances converge through that seam, then two
  real p2panda peers reconcile independently authored logs. The lossless fold
  exposes same-document conflicts without hiding unrelated documents.
  Resolution names exact causal operation ids, and adversarial tests prove it
  neither erases an unseen concurrent version nor accepts a target outside its
  history. The signed `PersonalVaultV1` and `CommonsDataV1` profiles prevent
  cross-profile replay. Separate personal vault keys can read communal
  documents through a shared group epoch, while a removed member cannot read
  an operation sealed after rotation.
- **K6. Writers. Complete locally 2026-07-27.** Per-format serializers render
  to `.knot`, `.md`, `.djot`, or `.json`. Untouched files never enter the
  write path. Tests prove foreign-format fixed points, byte-exact canonical
  `.knot`, and caller-selected output format.
- **K7. Editor half. Complete locally 2026-07-27.** `KnotEditor` consumes
  Cambium's `TextInput` and `TextCommand` as its only source buffer, preserves
  byte-plus-affinity layout selections, and keeps `KnotReadout` derived for
  highlights, outline, folds, and preview. IME preedit stays outside committed
  source, undo restores every readout, and committed source writes through to
  `.knot`. The corresponding Genet primitive is committed locally at
  `44e291afe8b`; remote reproducibility waits only on publishing it.

**Carrier note.** Graphshell protocol 1.1 adds the revision bell:
`CarrierNotice { session, epoch, revision }`. It carries no scene payload.
The notifying stdio server reads requests on a helper thread so quiet input
does not block watcher polls, while one writer keeps notices and keyed
responses line-atomic. `StdioCarrier` separates the two frame shapes;
Graphshell marks the mounted scene stale and resumes from its own last
acknowledgement. Disclosure authorization is unchanged because content still
flows only through `ProjectionSource` on request. A real-process receipt edits
a mounted Knot directory, receives one bell, resumes, and receives the newer
snapshot. The rejected held-open watch request remains rejected because it
would head-of-line block other session work.

## 6. Non-goals

Not a new repository. Not a Turnstone fork, and not a rival to it: the protocol
boundary is what keeps this a pressure vessel that promotes stable pieces
rather than inverting into a second product, the same rule Strophe holds for
the audio layer. Not an IDE, per the Genet ruling that knot's destination is
the authoring browser. No separate notes product competing with Turnstone for
the same users.

## Progress

- **2026-07-25.** Port home ruled, name chosen, stack surveyed against the
  actual tree, gaps and gates recorded. No code. Same session: the open
  question in Genet's pelt/knot direction doc resolved (the schema is the
  shared basis; content classes unify, stores diverge, settings excepted).
- **2026-07-25, review pass with Mark.** Carrier verified pull-only against
  `chirograph` (K1 ships on resume polling; the revision bell is
  proposed in the carrier note). K1 gains rename-preserves-identity, the
  disk-is-authoritative and write-through rules, the servitor identity for
  the watcher, and debounce over bulk churn. The multi-writer gate records
  that an autonomous disk writer raises the convergence decision's priority.
  K4 seals the vault-lane index and routes agent reads through grants at
  zero marginal crypto cost. K6 drops universal byte-identity: foreign
  formats round-trip idempotently, `.knot` byte-exact.
- **2026-07-27.** The Genet text-editing primitive completed T0 through T4 and
  cleared K7's implementation gate. Fullweb forms and contenteditable remain
  later consumers of the same primitive and do not block Knot.
- **2026-07-27, live-tree recut and first execution.** The old plan was stale
  in three places: replication had promoted to Stickleback, content classes had
  landed in chartulary and Turnstone, and the Knot readout/editor support had
  moved into Genet. K0 through K2 landed in that first pass, where `cargo test
  -p knot` passed twelve tests and warning-denying `cargo clippy -p knot
  --all-targets --no-deps` passed. The dependency-inclusive warning-denying
  Clippy gate stopped in pre-existing `numen::FieldId`/`CouplingId`
  `new_without_default` findings.
- **2026-07-27, completion pass.** K3 through K7 landed locally. `cargo test -p
  knot` passes 28 tests, including real p2panda convergence.
  `cargo clippy -p knot --all-targets --no-deps -- -D warnings` and `cargo
  check -p knot --all-targets` pass. The independent G4 receipt still mounts
  four sessions from Turnstone, Isometry, and Knot and regenerates at
  `28459BF5591CFB67CCCAD09BF5D2AFCD1F829FADE644C724F1E4DEBC6A076E60`.
- **2026-07-27, closure pass.** The Genet text primitive landed locally at
  `44e291afe8b`. Knot gained signed personal/Commons encryption profiles,
  retained group data epochs, and explicit causal resolution. Graphshell
  protocol 1.1 gained the revision bell and the stdio/host recovery path.
  Focused library suites pass 39 Graphshell, 9 protocol, 5 stdio, and 36 Knot
  tests; the separate real-process Knot bell/resume test also passes.
