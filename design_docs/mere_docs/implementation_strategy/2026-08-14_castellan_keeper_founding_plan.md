# Castellan Keeper Founding: the Identity Surface Moves to Its Port

**Status:** complete: the keeper surface moved, its feature matrix and direct-consumer receipt passed, and the subsequent Titulus/Chirograph and wire-string corrections landed.

**2026-08-14.** Executes the correction recorded in the
[family-shared identity plan](2026-08-08_family_shared_identity_plan.md):
graphshell's H4 identity surface is, by the
[port law](../../2026-08-12_family_composition_thesis_brief.md), castellan's
surface — the stack owns the capability (`personae`), the port is its
first-party embeddable embodiment (castellan), and applications compose the
relevant subset (graphshell). Keeping it in graphshell is the failure the law
names: a capability "technically reusable but practically trapped inside its
first application." Mark ruled the founding 2026-08-14 ("let's found").

Anchors: [credential port + gazette brief](../research/2026-08-10_credential_port_gazette_brief.md)
(the split and the vocabulary, ratified 2026-08-10), the
[composition thesis](../../2026-08-12_family_composition_thesis_brief.md)
(the port law and the "castellan owns no repository" correction).

## What moves, and where it lands

Three modules, moved whole with their tests, under one new castellan feature
`keeper` (the office; it covers both halves the brief names):

| From (graphshell) | To (castellan) | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `src/identity.rs` | `src/view.rs` | The secret-free read model: `IdentitySurfaceSnapshot`, vault/profile/key/device views, `load_carry_view`. The "embeddable half renders *about* secrets and never contains them" contract, as types. |
| `src/identity_projection.rs` | `src/projection.rs` | The cards, the intents (signing decisions, SSH generate/import/remove, device revoke, profile switch, profile create), `render_identity_surface`. |
| `src/native/personae_host.rs` | `src/authority.rs` | `PersonaeHost`: the resident authority. Holds the vault, serves the SSH agent, brokers approvals, applies intents. The authority half. |

Graphshell keeps thin re-export shims at every old path, so no call site in
its endpoint, native hosts, receipt bins, or tests changes. Graphshell also
keeps what is genuinely composition rather than capability:

- `identity_endpoint.rs` — serving the surface over graphshell's projection
  protocol is graphshell-as-host.
- `native/identity_ui.rs` — the native file-picker/passphrase dialogs compose
  castellan's authority with a desktop dialog backend (`light_file_dialog`);
  a host concern.
- `profile.rs` — `GraphshellIdentity` is the application's own identity
  composition (which persona *this app* speaks as).

## Decisions

- **Wire strings renamed the same day** (2026-08-14, Mark: "the wire strings
  too"). `graphshell.identity.*` became `castellan.*`, following the convention
  `knot.*` had already set: the port names its own intents. The identity family
  was in graphshell's namespace only because graphshell is where it first grew.

  The other `graphshell.*` intents stay exactly where they are, because they
  genuinely are the portal's: `address.open`, `editable-text.save`, the
  transfer lane.

  Cheaper than this plan first feared: no sibling repo names these strings, so
  the blast radius was sixteen constants, the browser extension bridge, and the
  docs. The bridge held the one place the namespace *shape* was load-bearing
  rather than incidental — a `startsWith("graphshell.identity.signing.")` guard
  routing every signing approval — which would have failed silently rather than
  loudly had the sweep missed it.

  **Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** the rename's commit, `617ea210`, is
  dated 2026-08-15, as the follow-ups below record, not the same day.

  **Receipts under `docs/receipts/` were deliberately not rewritten.** They
  record what a run produced on its date, and editing evidence to match today's
  vocabulary is how a receipt stops being one. The persona-switch receipt was
  regenerated instead, because it is current rather than historical.

  The built bundles under `web/extension/dist/` are gitignored output of
  `prepare-extension`, so the repo was never wrong — but a locally loaded
  extension would have gone on sending intents the host no longer answered.
  Rebuilt.
- **`keeper` is one feature, not two.** The brief's embeddable/authority split
  suggests two, but the projection already renders pending signing requests
  (`personae::signing`, agent-gated), so the halves share the heavy
  dependency today. Split when a consumer exists that wants views without
  the agent stack (a web host is the likely one).
- **Castellan stops being a name reservation.** Its manifest description and
  README change from "Name reservation" to a dated statement of what is
  implemented: OTP, the reticulum credential seam, and the keeper surface.

## Verified

Four feature combinations, because adding an optional-dep feature is the way
to break the ones nobody runs: default (29 tests), `station-grants`, `keeper`
(46 tests), and `keeper,station-grants`. Graphshell: 106 lib tests, all bins
under `personal-sync`, and the persona-switch receipt rerun green while
importing castellan directly.

Every consumer of the three moved paths is inside graphshell itself (the
endpoint, `browser_host`, `device_broker`, `session_loop`, `app`, and four
receipt bins). No sibling repo names them, so the shims are the whole
compatibility surface.

## Resolved after the move

**`identity_endpoint` stays in graphshell, and the line is not close.** It
names ~23 `graphshell_protocol` types plus `graphshell_endpoint`'s serving
machinery (`ProjectionCatalog`, `ProjectionSource`, `IntentSink`) and the
sceno/scenotime scene stack. Castellan's projection names three
(`PortableCardV1`, `CardValueV1`, `ActionFormV1`). The endpoint is the adapter
that *serves* castellan's cards over graphshell's protocol — composition, and
the count is the evidence.

**The `castellan → graphshell-protocol` direction is the one real wart, and
it is cheap today.** The three types castellan needs are neutral by content —
"a deliberately small semantic card, not a serialized widget tree" — and the
crate is light (six dependencies: base64, blake3, sceno, scenotime, serde,
serde_json). So nothing is being dragged; what is wrong is only that the
identity port names an application's crate.

Two ways out, both **Mark's call because both are naming decisions**:

1. Extract the card vocabulary (`PortableCardV1`, `CardValueV1`,
   `ActionFormV1`, `ContentHash`) into a neutral crate both depend on. It
   meets the crate bar — a portable subset with a real consumer that wants it
   without the protocol — but it needs a name.
2. Rename `graphshell-protocol` to what it is. It is the family's projection
   contract, not graphshell's; the crate is named after the portal that
   happened to define it. This is the same shape of correction the keeper
   founding just made, one layer down.

Doing neither is also defensible while castellan is the only outside consumer.

**Ruled 2026-08-15: both.** Mark took 1 and 2 together. The card vocabulary
became [titulus](https://crates.io/crates/titulus) and `graphshell-protocol`
became [chirograph](https://crates.io/crates/chirograph), both published 0.0.1.
The crate names in this section are left as they were written, per the receipt
rule; read them as the pre-rename vocabulary.

**Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** titulus was folded back into chirograph
in `83feb122` (2026-09-23, recorded in the
[crate consolidation plan](2026-09-23_crate_consolidation_plan.md)). At mere
`535bca11` there is no titulus crate, only `crates/chirograph/src/titulus.rs`;
castellan imports the cards from chirograph (`ports/castellan/src/projection.rs`,
line 21), and chirograph is at 0.0.2.

## Follow-ups, not this pass

- Publishing castellan 0.0.2 with the keeper feature needs graphshell-protocol
  publishable first; not scheduled, and entangled with the question above.
  **Done 2026-08-15:** titulus 0.0.1 and chirograph 0.0.1 shipped first, then
  castellan 0.0.2 with `keeper`. A registry-only probe outside the workspace
  (no path deps, no patch table) confirmed the feature resolves from crates.io
  alone, which `cargo publish` does not check: it verifies default features only.
- The wire strings (`graphshell.identity.*`) are the third instance of the
  same naming question, at the protocol level rather than the crate level.
  Worth deciding all three together rather than piecemeal.
  **Done 2026-08-15** (`617ea210`): decided with the other two.
  `graphshell.identity.*` became `castellan.*`; the resolution is recorded
  in the wire-strings section above.

## Progress

- **2026-10-06 (S14 pass).** Status and claims corrected against the tree at
  mere 535bca11, from the D2 record in
  support/doc-audit/d2/batch_43_s14_phase_b5.md: a dated note on titulus's
  fold back into chirograph (`83feb122`), and the wire-string rename's date
  reconciled with `617ea210`.
