# Commitment Proof Interface Plan

**Date**: 2026-06-30  
**Status (2026-10-06):** the shared type interface landed 2026-07-13
(`2fb78c43`, `crates/system/proofs`); the proof types, the verifiers and the
backends remain planned. Done-conditions 1–3 are unbuilt: no
`MootEpochHeader`, `RoleWitness` or `DelegationProof` exists, and condition
3's kith grants belong to a plan retired 2026-09-02 (see the open question
under Done Conditions). Conditions 4 and 5 could not be confirmed by the S14
pass.

This plan owns the proof interface for moot epochs, tessera receipts, kith
grants, storage checkpoints, and mesh result evidence. The interface is shaped
around what a proof means, not around one tree implementation.

---

## Decision

Do not expose a `MerkleTree` as the model. Expose typed commitments and typed
proofs:

```rust
pub enum CommitmentScheme {
    MerkleV1,
    SparseMerkleV1,
    MmrV1,
    AccumulatorV1,
    VectorCommitmentV1,
    PsiCardinalityV1,
}

pub enum CommitmentDomain {
    MootAdmins,
    MootMods,
    MootStakeholders,
    MootMembers,
    TesseraReceipts,
    StorageChunks,
    StorageCheckpoints,
    MeshJobResults,
    DelegationSet,
}

pub struct Digest {
    pub alg: DigestAlg,
    pub bytes: Vec<u8>,
}

pub enum DigestAlg {
    Blake3,
    P2pandaOperation,
    Sha256,
    William3,
}

pub struct Commitment {
    pub scheme: CommitmentScheme,
    pub domain: CommitmentDomain,
    pub version: u16,
    pub digest: Digest,
}
```

**Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** the code samples in this plan are
illustrative, not compile-ready. The landed types are in
`crates/system/proofs/src/lib.rs`: `CommitmentScheme` adds `DigestV1` (a
direct digest over canonical bytes, no tree claim), and `CommitmentDomain` has
`StandingReceipts` where this sample has `TesseraReceipts`, which survives only
as a serde alias after the 2026-08-31 terminology ruling (`50b39f95`).

The `DigestAlg` names the digest family. The `CommitmentScheme` names how the
digest should be interpreted as a proof root. This prevents three meanings from
colliding:

- p2panda operation hashes identify signed operations and their log order
- commitment digests identify application-level proof roots
- blob/content digests address stored bytes

---

## Proof Types

```rust
pub struct InclusionProof {
    pub commitment: Commitment,
    pub subject: Digest,
    pub proof_bytes: Vec<u8>,
}

pub struct NonInclusionProof {
    pub commitment: Commitment,
    pub subject: Digest,
    pub proof_bytes: Vec<u8>,
}

pub struct AppendProof {
    pub previous: Commitment,
    pub next: Commitment,
    pub appended_range: Range<u64>,
    pub proof_bytes: Vec<u8>,
}

pub struct SetRelationProof {
    pub left: Commitment,
    pub right: Commitment,
    pub relation: SetRelation,
    pub proof_bytes: Vec<u8>,
}

pub enum SetRelation {
    IsMember,
    IsNotMember,
    Subset,
    OverlapCountAtLeast(u64),
    ThresholdSigned(u16),
}
```

Callers ask for facts:

```rust
verify_membership(proof, subject, commitment) -> bool
verify_non_membership(proof, subject, commitment) -> bool
verify_append(proof, previous, next) -> bool
verify_overlap(proof, old_epoch, new_epoch) -> SetRelationResult
```

They do not walk a tree directly.

---

## Default Scheme Map

Start conservative:

- role rosters: `SparseMerkleV1`
- tessera receipt logs: `MmrV1`
- storage chunks: `MerkleV1`
- storage checkpoint logs: `MmrV1`
- mesh result batches: `MerkleV1` or `MmrV1` depending on append pressure
- private membership overlap: defer to `PsiCardinalityV1`

The first build can implement only `MerkleV1`, `SparseMerkleV1`, and `MmrV1`.
The others stay enum slots until scale or privacy pressure justifies them.

---

## P2panda Boundary

The commitment interface is p2panda-compliant only if it remains application
payload/projection metadata.

P2panda owns:

- operation authorship and signatures
- per-author append-only log sequence and backlinks
- topics and LogSync replication
- operation identity through the operation hash

Mere owns:

- moot epoch commitments
- role and membership proofs
- tessera receipt witnesses
- storage checkpoint witnesses
- mesh result and verifier evidence

So a p2panda operation should carry a logical event body such as:

```rust
pub enum MootEvent {
    EpochDeclared {
        epoch: u64,
        constitution: Digest,
        role_commitments: Vec<RoleCommitment>,
    },
    WorkReceiptIssued {
        receipt: WorkReceipt,
    },
    GrantIssued {
        grant: MeshGrant,
    },
    GrantRevoked {
        grant_id: GrantId,
        epoch: u64,
    },
}
```

The p2panda operation proves who authored the event and where it sits in that
author's log. The commitment proof proves a claim inside the event's social or
application meaning.

Do not:

- replace p2panda operation hashes with commitment digests
- treat an MMR or Merkle root as the p2panda log head
- put scheme-specific proof logic into operation header extensions
- use application proofs as a substitute for p2panda signature or backlink
  validation

---

## Done Conditions

- `MootEpochHeader` stores role commitments, not raw `*_root: Hash` fields.
- Work receipts carry typed `RoleWitness` and optional `DelegationProof`.
- Kith grants can name a delegation commitment without assuming a Merkle tree.
- Storage checkpoints distinguish chunk commitments from checkpoint-log
  commitments.
- p2panda wire docs say that commitments live in event bodies and projections,
  not operation headers.

**Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** none of `InclusionProof`, `AppendProof`,
`SetRelationProof`, `MootEpochHeader`, `RoleWitness` or `DelegationProof`
exists in any `.rs` file, so conditions 1 and 2 are unbuilt. Condition 3 and
the ownership sentence at the top name kith grants, but the kith capability
sharing plan was retired on 2026-09-02, its subject deleted or abandoned.
Retention checkpoints bind a `BlobRef` plus a `StorageCheckpoints` commitment;
`StorageChunks` is unused, so condition 4 is a judgment call, and no p2panda
wire statement for condition 5 was found.

**Open, raised by the S14 pass (2026-10-06):** what does condition 3 target
now that kith is retired? Options: drop it; re-target it to the capability
model's servitor grants; hold it until a grant surface names a delegation
commitment.

## Progress

- **2026-06-30** - Created after reviewing Merkle alternatives. The plan keeps
  Merkle as the first backend while preserving MMR, sparse Merkle, accumulator,
  vector-commitment, and private-set-cardinality lanes behind one typed proof
  surface.
- **2026-07-13** - Landed the neutral `proofs` crate with typed `Digest`,
  `Commitment`, `CommitmentScheme`, `CommitmentDomain`, and `BlobRef`. Added
  `DigestV1` for direct commitments to canonical bytes so callers do not make a
  false Merkle claim. Mesh retention checkpoints now bind both a content
  reference and a `StorageCheckpoints` commitment while keeping their p2panda
  operation identity separate. Scheme-specific proof verification remains.
- **2026-10-06 (S14 pass).** Status and claims corrected against the tree at mere 535bca11, from the D2 record in support/doc-audit/d2/batch_41_s14_phase_b3.md: the status now names done-conditions 1–3 as unbuilt, the code samples are labelled illustrative against `crates/system/proofs/src/lib.rs`, and condition 3's retired kith target raised as an open question.
