# Engine picker + pluggability — implementation plan

**Date**: 2026-06-15
**Status (2026-10-06):** Phases 0 to 3 (route, activate, manage, pick) landed
in meerkat on 2026-06-15 (`d4a1350`, `1966183`, `e90825e`, `b4706c6`,
`c5f63d8`, `a7e609e`), retired with it 2026-07-18 (`c5f01064`);
`EngineActivation`, `engine_pins` and `route_document_engine` left with it.
Surviving library parts: `EngineRoutePolicy` (`route_filtered`,
`per_host_overrides`) and `is_surface_engine` in `inker::routing`, consumed by
Pelt, `crates/import`'s web clip, the `mere::routing` facade and Turnstone;
pandect's `disabled_engines` settings field, with no consumer outside pandect;
and the graft and weld `SurfaceEngine` impls (`f5c3d9cb`). Page capture P1
landed at the Inker boundary on 2026-08-30 (host-minted request ids,
viewport-only requests, typed PNG outputs, explicit unknown CSS facts, a
correlated hosted completion event); no engine declares capture support yet.
Open: Phase 2b (per-host override editor, per-session toggle), Phase 4
(no-handler UX, local-file sniff), Phase 5 (the verso flip and the
`ScryingTileEngine`/`ProducerFactory` registry fold-in) and the register-viewer
harvest, none of which has had a host since meerkat left. *(The §2 "Findings"
below are the pre-Phase-0 state.)*
**Scope**: The user-facing engine **picker** (an inker affordance), the
**pluggability / extension model** that makes engines build-, session-, and
activation-managable, the no-handler fallback, local-file ingestion, and the
two content tiers. Stops where **verso** begins: carrying live state across a
flip is the [verso charter](../../verso_docs/technical_architecture/2026-06-10_compatibility_view_charter.md),
sequenced here as the final phase.

**Related**:

- [verso compatibility-view charter](../../verso_docs/technical_architecture/2026-06-10_compatibility_view_charter.md) — ownership split (picker = inker, flip = verso), one-hop invariant, sequencing gate. This plan is the picker half of that charter's step 2.
- engine profile boundary plan (`mere/design_docs/archive_docs/2026-10-06_retired_plans/2026-05-14_engine_profile_boundary_plan.md`) — `EngineProfileBinding` (Persona/Session/Graph scoping). The activation model here mirrors that tiering.
- browser multiplexer framing (`mere/design_docs/mere_docs/research/2026-05-11_browser_multiplexer_framing.md`) §5.4, §7, §8 — engines as replaceable producers; "engine route override" capability; `engine.route_chosen` / `engine.route_degraded` diagnostics.
- modular integration plan (`mere/design_docs/archive_docs/2026-10-06_superseded_plans/2026-06-02_modular_integration_plan.md`) §1.9, §6 — the `register-viewer` vs `inker::routing` dual-routing reconcile, gated on "meerkat first routes >1 content engine."
- engine peers + scrying library brief (`mere/design_docs/mere_docs/research/2026-05-11_engine_peers_and_scrying_library_brief.md`) — `scrying.web` / `wry.web` as opt-in engines.

---

## 1. Goal + the ownership split

**Goal:** a session where the user can see which engine renders a given piece
of content, switch it (per node and per host), and manage which engines exist /
are active / are off, with graceful behaviour when nothing handles a scheme.

Three owners, held to the verso charter:

- **Picking** an engine = `inker` routing ([routing.rs](../../../crates/inker/inker/src/routing.rs)). The picker UI writes pins / overrides into that policy.
- **Texture plumbing** = scry / graft / weld + netrender compose + constellation actors. Untouched by this plan.
- **The flip** (live state carried across an engine swap) = `verso`. Phase 5 only; minted at the first genet→scrying flip per the charter.

In-product vocabulary stays plain: "compatibility view", "flip", "open in
\<engine\>". `verso` / `inker` are crate names, not UI words.

## 2. Findings — what already exists

The routing backend is substantially built; meerkat just does not consume it.

**Routing (live, canonical).** [`EngineRoutePolicy::route_filtered`](../../../crates/inker/inker/src/routing.rs) decides by precedence **pinned_engine → content-type → per-host override → scheme → fallback**, and `route_filtered(is_available)` skips any engine the host lacks, walking to the next rule. `EngineRouteRequest` already carries `pinned_engine: Option<String>` and the policy carries `per_host_overrides: HashMap<host, engine_id>`. Unhandled schemes fall to `ENGINE_EXTERNAL_PROTOCOL` (`host.external-protocol`, Headless). `scrying.web` / `wry.web` are defined but deliberately out of the default policy (opt-in via pin / override).

**Two registries = two tiers (the key structural fact).** The tier split the user described is already the two registries, and it is the same axis as the charter's glass-box / black-box fidelity axis and the wasm/native build axis:

| Tier | Seam | Output | Fidelity | Build | Engines |
|------|------|--------|----------|-------|---------|
| 1 — web platform | [`Engine`](../../../crates/inker/inker/src/engine.rs) → `EngineRegistry` | portable `EngineDocument` | glass-box (full export → good verso donor) | wasm32-safe, always in | `nematic.*`, `genet.web` |
| 2 — native | [`SurfaceEngine`](../../../crates/inker/inker/src/surface_engine.rs) → `SurfaceEngineRegistry` | GPU `SurfaceFrame` texture | black-box (inject most, extract little) | native only, vendored | `scrying.web` (live), `weld`, `graft` |

The scry tier-2 engine is real: [`ScryingTileEngine`](../../../crates/inker/engines/scrying-engine/src/engine.rs) implements `SurfaceEngine` (id `scrying.web`) over a host-supplied `ProducerFactory`.

**Profile scoping.** `EngineProfileBinding` (Persona / Session / Graph) and the pure `engine_profile_path` resolver already exist in `session-runtime`; this plan reuses that tiering shape for *activation* scope.

**The gap.** *(Closed by Phase 0, shipped 2026-06-15; this paragraph is the
pre-Phase-0 record, kept for the Findings narrative.)* meerkat does **not** route
through `EngineRoutePolicy` at all. It registers `nematic::engines()` only for snapshot cards, drives live content through the constellation, and runs scry through an ad-hoc `compat_pins: HashSet<GraphMemberId>` bool (the path the 2026-06-15 multi-tile work extended). The modular integration plan §6 (`mere/design_docs/archive_docs/2026-10-06_superseded_plans/2026-06-02_modular_integration_plan.md`) names the same gap: `register-viewer` (mime→viewer) duplicates `inker::routing`; reconcile when meerkat first routes >1 content engine. That moment is Phase 0.

## 3. Architecture decisions

1. **Three activation levels collapse to one predicate.** `is_available(id) = registry.contains(id) && enabled(id)`.
   - *Not in build* → not registered (cargo feature off / not vendored).
   - *In build, deactivated* → registered but `enabled(id) == false`: routing never picks it, no actor / producer spawns, the binary still carries it.
   - *Active* → registered + enabled.
   The routing already takes the `is_available` closure; only the enable set is new.
2. **Activation scope = global default + per-session override** (user decision, 2026-06-15). A global `EngineEnableSet` (app setting) is the default; a session manifest field overrides per engine id. Mirrors `EngineProfileBinding`'s persona/session tiering. Graph scope is reserved, not built.
3. **Build tier via cargo features.** Tier 1 (`Engine` document engines) is the always-present portable baseline (ships to wasm/PWA). Tier 2 (`SurfaceEngine`) crates are feature-gated and vendored per platform; absent on wasm, where the no-handler fallback covers the hole. One feature per surface-engine crate (`scrying`, `weld`, `graft`).
4. **No-handler is already correct, just invisible.** Keep `host.external-protocol` as the fallback; make it *legible*: emit `engine.route_degraded`, and have the picker offer "open externally" or "enable an engine that handles \<scheme\>".
5. **Local files are not special.** A `file://` address feeds the same routing; the only twist is no server MIME, so a content-sniffer (extension + magic bytes) populates `EngineRouteRequest.content_type`, and "genet renders anything web-standard" becomes the http rule applied to local bytes. nematic lanes and markdown re-route by sniffed type exactly as network content does.
6. **Engines are the first instance of a general extension mechanism.** The GUI itself (genet rendering host chrome) is the bootstrap engine. The enable/registry/build model here is the extension model; later extension classes (protocols, scripting) reuse `is_available` + the build/session/active levels rather than inventing their own.

## 4. Phases (sequence)

Done-conditions, not dates (per house rule).

**Phase 0 — routing reconcile + meerkat onto `EngineRoutePolicy`** *(foundation; unblocks all)*

Routing in meerkat is genuinely **two-altitude**, and the policy was already
designed for exactly that (its comment: "the same address can re-route after the
host learns the MIME type from a response"). So Phase 0 splits:

- **0a — UI-thread tier decision (DONE, d4a1350).** At nav time the host knows the
  url (scheme) and the node's pin but not yet the content-type. `compat_pins:
  HashSet<member>` became `engine_pins: HashMap<member, engine_id>`; the host holds
  a `route_policy`; each node routes via `route_filtered(request{pinned_engine},
  is_available)`, and `is_surface_engine(decision.engine_id)` picks the scrying lane
  vs the constellation. The compatibility view is a pin to `scrying.web`. Added
  `inker::routing::is_surface_engine` as the canonical tier-2 classifier.
  *Verified:* a `>compat_view` node renders through WebView2 via the route (producer
  spawns, no `EngineNotFound`); normal http/gemini unchanged.
- **0b — actor content-type pass (DONE, 1966183).** `render_content_scene` now
  routes through the policy (`route_document_engine` → `genet.web` html lane vs a
  registered nematic engine); `engine_id_for`, `is_html`, `base_type` deleted. The
  canonical `EngineRoutePolicy::default` was made a **superset** of the old match: a
  `titan` scheme rule + `ENGINE_NEMATIC_TITAN`, and content-type rules for
  `text/html`/`application/xhtml+xml` → `genet.web` (HTML → genet regardless of
  scheme, so a local `file://` HTML page lands on the web engine — Phase 4 arriving
  early) plus the smolweb refinements. *Verified:* inker routing 25/25, card 10/10;
  headed, https HTML renders via genet and a gemini capsule via nematic.gemtext,
  both via the one policy.
- **register-viewer harvest** turned out to be *latent* (a11y/security/storage/history
  capability declarations, not the live mime table; not wired into meerkat), so it is
  a separate small follow-up, not part of this reconcile.
- *Phase 0 done (both shipped):* both altitudes consult one `route_policy`; the
  bespoke selectors (`compat_pins`, `engine_id_for`, `is_html`) are gone.

**Phase 1 — activation model (DONE, e90825e).** `engine_available` split into
`engine_present` (host capability) AND `engine_active` (not deactivated), so the
policy walks past a deactivated engine like an absent one. `EngineActivation` holds
two layers (per-session override wins over global default): `global_disabled` from
the app-wide `settings.json` `disabled_engines` (new field), `session_override`
in memory for the Phase 2 toggle. Host lanes (internal / external / ingest) are
structural, not deactivatable. Deactivation needs no explicit reap — a no-longer-
surface node drops out of `scrying_surfaces`, and the per-frame `retain` tears its
producer down. *Verified:* engine_activation 4/4, settings_store 7/7; headed, with
`scrying.web` disabled a `>compat_view` node falls back to genet with no producer,
and re-enabling spawns it again.
- **Phase 1b (DONE, b4706c6):** the constellation carries the deactivated-engine set
  (`set_disabled_engines`, seeded from settings) and passes it to each spawned actor,
  which registers only the engines outside it — so a deactivated *document* engine is
  routed past by `route_document_engine` and falls to the synthesized card. Snapshot
  at spawn time; the Phase 2 live toggle reaps affected actors. *Verified:* with
  `nematic.gemtext` disabled, a gemini capsule renders the synthesized fallback (raw
  `#`/`##` text) instead of the formatted gemtext document.
- **Per-session persistence:** `session_override` is in memory; it persists when the
  session manifest is wired (multiplexer §3).

**Phase 2 — engine manager (apparatus pane) (DONE, a7e609e).** The apparatus pane
gained an "Engines" section: every present user-facing engine (Genet + System
WebView headline, then the nematic document engines) as an active/off toggle button,
active ones highlighted. Clicking flips the engine's **global** activation
(`engine:toggle:<id>` → `toggle_engine`), pushes the deactivated set to the actor
pool, and persists to `settings.json`. *Verified:* toggling System WebView off writes
`disabled_engines:["scrying.web"]`, toggling on clears it.
- **Phase 2b (deferred):** the `per_host_overrides` editor (host text field + engine
  choice) and a per-session toggle (vs the global one this ships). Absent engines are
  simply not listed; an explicit "in build / absent" row is cosmetic, deferred.

**Phase 3 — per-node picker (DONE, c5f63d8).** The single-node context menu offers
"Auto (default engine)" + "Open in \<engine\>" for each pickable web/surface engine
that is `engine_available`, the current choice ✓-marked; picking writes `engine_pins`
(Auto clears it). `ContextAction::PinEngine(&'static str)` + `AutoEngine`. *Verified:*
menu shows Auto ✓ / Genet / System WebView (Wry filtered out); clicking System
WebView flips the node from genet to a live WebView2.

**Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** Phases 0 to 3 were built in meerkat, which
was deleted in `c5f01064` (2026-07-18): `EngineActivation`, `engine_pins` and
`route_document_engine` have no hits in code at mere 535bca11. What
survives is the library half: `EngineRoutePolicy` and `is_surface_engine` in
`crates/inker/inker/src/routing.rs`, consumed by Pelt
(`ports/pelt/core/src/workspace.rs`), `crates/import/src/web_clip.rs`, the
`mere::routing` facade (`crates/mere/src/routing.rs`) and Turnstone; and
pandect's `disabled_engines` settings field, which nothing outside pandect
reads.

**Phase 4 — no-handler UX + local files**
- Surface `route_degraded` in the picker; "open externally" affordance. Content-sniffer for `file://` feeding `content_type`; genet as the web-standard default for local files.
- *Done when:* opening a local `.md` routes to nematic.markdown, a local `.html` to genet, and an unhandled scheme shows the explicit "no engine / open externally" state.

**Phase 5 — verso flip** *(charter step 3; separate doc owns detail)*
- Mint `verso` at the first genet→scrying flip: one carrier, flip choreography on one tile, state carried (URL, scroll, cookies, snapshot), tile identity + lineage intact, one-hop invariant enforced.
- This plan's Phases 0–4 are the prerequisite (engines must be user-visible and pinnable before a flip means anything). Detail lives in a verso_docs plan when minted.

**Build-tier track (parallel).** Feature-gate the tier-2 engine crates; confirm a tier-1-only build (no scry/weld/graft) compiles and runs, routing tier-2 schemes to the fallback. This is the wasm/PWA shape proven on the desktop build.

## 5. Background / dependencies

- Phase 0 is the gate the integration plan already named ("resolve when meerkat first routes >1 content engine"). It is also the honest home for the multi-tile scry path: that work is correct but lives outside routing, and Phase 0 is where it rejoins.
- The picker (Phases 2–3) depends only on Phase 0–1, not on verso. Verso (Phase 5) depends on the picker existing.
- weld (CEF) and graft (Servo) producers are tier-2 `SurfaceEngine` impls parallel to `ScryingTileEngine`; their build-out is tracked separately but slots into this model as additional registered ids with feature gates. They do not block the picker.
- Activation reaping must route through the capability-gated action bus when that lands (multiplexer §7: "engine route override" and "profile escalation" are gated actions); until then it is a direct host op with a diagnostic.

## Findings

- 2026-10-06: Turnstone's direct Welding 0.15 consumer exposed two input gaps
  in `crates/inker/engines/weld-engine/src/welding_0_15.rs`: mouse
  `PointerEvent` always entered the touch-only mapper, and raw key events did
  not deliver composed text through CEF's separate CHAR path. Native lowercase
  input needs the character code in CHAR's `windows_key_code`; virtual A (65)
  inserts uppercase A even when the supplied text is lowercase a.

- 2026-06-15: Routing precedence, `pinned_engine`, `per_host_overrides`, `route_filtered`, and the `host.external-protocol` fallback are all already implemented in [routing.rs](../../../crates/inker/inker/src/routing.rs). The two registries ([engine.rs](../../../crates/inker/inker/src/engine.rs), [surface_engine.rs](../../../crates/inker/inker/src/surface_engine.rs)) cleanly encode the user's two-tier model, and that split coincides with the charter's glass/black-box fidelity axis and the wasm/native build axis. The single missing piece for a picker is consumption: meerkat routes nothing through the policy today.
- 2026-06-15: The verso charter (Mark, 2026-06-10) already assigns the picker to inker and reserves verso for the flip. The user's "verso = engine switcher" framing resolves to picker (inker) + flip (verso) composed.
- 2026-06-15: meerkat's content routing is **two-altitude**, and that is inherent, not accidental: at nav time the host has the url (scheme + pin) but not the content-type, which only the off-thread actor learns post-fetch. The policy is built for this (scheme/pin first pass, content-type second pass), so Phase 0 splits cleanly into 0a (UI-thread tier + pin) and 0b (actor content-type), both consulting one `route_policy`. The `is_available` closure must report *true* for the lanes meerkat handles without a document-registry entry (genet html, mere:// internal, external-protocol, linked-data) or an http node would wrongly fall through to the OS hand-off.

## Progress

- **2026-10-06, shared Weld input follow-up, in progress.** The direct adapter
  routes mouse pointers through `send_mouse_input`, retaining changed buttons,
  keyboard modifiers and the held primary/secondary/auxiliary button mask.
  Touch/pen retain their native contact route. Raw down/up keep virtual and
  scan codes; pressed composed text follows raw down as separate CHAR events
  in string order. A producer failure stops the remaining input sequence.
  Ordered browser completions and owned native-frame custody are unchanged.
  Library validation: `cargo test --offline --locked -p weld-engine --features
  welding-0-15 --target-dir C:/t/cargo-targets/mere` passed 11 tests and zero
  doctests. The five new dispatch tests cover lowercase/BMP text,
  down/up ordering, failures, rich mouse input, contact routing and the same
  ordered completion queue. The feature-disabled package's three tests passed
  too. The full active-doc audit retains 55 missing known-root paths and seven
  stale historical annotations elsewhere; focused HEAD/working audits of this
  plan both report zero findings. Consumer done-condition: immutable adapter source
  adoption with one Inker type identity passes Turnstone's real two-page
  input/find/zoom, permission and teardown scenarios before removing its host
  bridge. Broader Mere/Genet repins remain a separate integration decision.
  Supplementary Unicode is not qualified: pinned Welding's
  `cef_input::send_key` casts a Rust scalar directly to `u16`; native UTF-16
  delivery and OS IME require separate supplier/host work. Native consumer
  evidence lives at
  `turnstone/docs/receipts/browser_scry_windows_20261006/`; this library pass
  does not extend those receipts to its new source.

- 2026-08-30: **Page capture P1 contract landed.** Removed the old synchronous
  `SurfaceProducer::capture_snapshot_png` seam without a compatibility shim.
  Hosted surfaces now accept `PageCaptureRequest { id, scope: Viewport }` and
  complete through the ordered `WebSurfaceEvent::PageCaptureCompleted { id,
  result }` stream; errors retain the same id and the first concrete adapter
  can use `SurfaceError::Busy` for its one-flight rule. Retained
  `DocumentSession`s instead return the same `PageCaptureOutput` immediately,
  defaulting to `SessionError::Unsupported`, rather than gaining a second event
  queue. The output records only typed PNG bytes, physical output dimensions,
  optional CSS scroll/viewport facts, and optional engine-reported applied
  scale. Requested page scale and host provenance remain host-owned. No
  existing engine capability was promoted.

- 2026-06-15: scry-in-tile (single focused tile) shipped + verified (meerkat 0adca6e); multi-tile scry shipped + verified (06b6ac7) — two independent WebView2 panes on one shared `CompositionRoot`, per-pane input. This advances the verso charter's P4 (scrying tile as a live, interactive actor) but through the ad-hoc `compat_pins` path; Phase 0 folds it into routing.
- 2026-06-15: Plan authored from a read of routing.rs, engine.rs, surface_engine.rs, scrying-engine, the verso charter, the engine-profile-boundary plan, the browser-multiplexer framing, and the modular-integration plan. Activation scope decided: global default + per-session override.
- 2026-06-15: **Phase 0a shipped + verified (meerkat d4a1350).** `compat_pins` retired into `engine_pins: HashMap<member, engine_id>` + a host `route_policy`; the UI-thread tier decision routes via `route_filtered(request{pinned_engine}, is_available)` → `is_surface_engine` picks the scrying lane. Added `inker::routing::is_surface_engine`. `>compat_view` is now a pin to `scrying.web`. Headed-verified: pinned node renders through WebView2 via the route (producer spawns, no `EngineNotFound`); http/gemini nodes render unchanged through the constellation.
- 2026-06-15: **Phase 0b shipped + verified (meerkat 1966183). Phase 0 complete.** `render_content_scene` routes through the policy (`route_document_engine`); `engine_id_for` / `is_html` / `base_type` deleted; the canonical `EngineRoutePolicy::default` made a superset (titan scheme rule + `ENGINE_NEMATIC_TITAN`, `text/html` → `genet.web`, smolweb content-type refinements). Both routing altitudes (UI-thread tier, actor content-type) now consult one policy; all three bespoke selectors are gone. Verified: inker routing 25/25, card 10/10; headed, https HTML → genet and a gemini capsule → nematic.gemtext via the one policy.
- 2026-06-15: **Phase 1 shipped + verified (meerkat e90825e).** `engine_available` = `engine_present && engine_active`; `EngineActivation` (global default from `settings.json` `disabled_engines` + in-memory per-session override); host lanes exempt. Verified: engine_activation 4/4, settings_store 7/7; headed, `scrying.web` disabled → `>compat_view` node falls back to genet with no producer, re-enable spawns it again.
- 2026-06-15: **Phases 1b / 3 / 2 shipped + verified (b4706c6, c5f63d8, a7e609e).** 1b: the constellation passes its deactivated set to each spawned actor, which registers only enabled engines (disabled `nematic.gemtext` → synthesized fallback). 3: the single-node context menu offers Auto + "Open in \<engine\>" (✓-marked), writing `engine_pins`; clicking System WebView flips a node to a live WebView2. 2: the apparatus "Engines" section toggles each engine's global activation, persisted to `settings.json`. **The whole picker arc (route → activate → manage → pick) is in and verified. Remaining: Phase 4 (no-handler / local files), Phase 5 (weld/graft + verso flip), Phase 2b (per-host overrides + per-session toggle), register-viewer harvest.**
- 2026-06-24: the cross-repo grand audit (`genet/docs/2026-06-24_grand_audit.md`) (§5 sidequest 4) endorses registering graft(Servo) + weld(CEF) as tier-2 `SurfaceEngine` impls over the existing `wgpu-graft` / `wgpu-weld` texture-import producers — this is **Phase 5** here (weld/graft, distinct from the verso flip). The audit also re-confirms a still-open item the picker's Phase 0 did *not* close: meerkat's shipped scry pool routes its *pin* through the policy (Phase 0a/0b) but still binds `PlatformWebSurfaceProducer` **concretely** for frame transport, bypassing the `SurfaceEngine` registry (the WebView2 handle-handoff protocol the type-erased lane drops). Folding the producer construction into the registry is the natural Phase-5 companion to graft/weld.

  **Corrected 2026-10-06 (S14 pass):** Phase 5's weld and graft half has
  landed: `GraftEngine` (`crates/inker/engines/graft-engine/src/engine.rs`)
  and `WeldEngine` (`crates/inker/engines/weld-engine/src/engine.rs`)
  implement `SurfaceEngine` (added `f5c3d9cb`). The verso flip and the registry
  fold-in remain. The [scrying tile plan](../../archive_docs/2026-10-06_completed_plans/2026-06-10_scrying_tile_plan.md)
  calls that fold-in this plan's Phase 0; Phase 0 routed only the pin, and the
  fold-in is the Phase-5 companion named here.
- **2026-10-06 (S14 pass).** Status and claims corrected against the tree at
  mere 535bca11, from the D2 record in
  support/doc-audit/d2/batch_47_s14_phase_b9.md: Phases 0 to 3 recorded as
  landed in meerkat and retired with it (`c5f01064`), the surviving routing,
  settings and engine parts named, the graft and weld `SurfaceEngine` impls
  recorded as landed, and the Phase 0 versus Phase-5 naming of the registry
  fold-in reconciled with the scrying tile plan.

- **2026-10-06 Graft ordered host events.** `GraftSurface::poll_web_event`
  now permits a host's single delegate queue to preserve ordering across
  navigation, title/address changes, messages and correlated completions.
  `GraftProducer` forwards that queue directly. The default retains the old
  separate navigation/message polling behavior for existing implementers.
  Four focused Graft library tests pass, including a mixed-kind ordering
  regression whose legacy queue hooks reject accidental splitting.
  The frame seam now describes owned payload custody, per-paint synchronization,
  content generation versus allocation identity, and WebView-owned resize.
  This is a shared adapter qualification, not an upstream Servo construction
  or headed consumer receipt. Turnstone's process-owned Servo host and native
  page/input/resize/teardown gates remain separate implementation work.
