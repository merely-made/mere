# Eidetic development: content, encounters and computed memory

**Date:** 2026-10-11
**Status (2026-10-12):** active plan. The first Fleece portable-clip draft has
native transfer tests and browser compilation. Turnstone now qualifies native
selected text/WAV receiving, restart, local playback and onward copy; the broader phases
and remaining host checkpoints stay open. The five gathering/intake dependency
moves are already complete in the
[Fleece and Eidetic checkpoint](../../archive_docs/2026-10-11_completed_plans/2026-10-11_fleece_eidetic_capability_plan.md).
**Scope:** develop Eidetic's retained-content and memory capabilities together
with Chartulary/Stemma, Muniment, Pandect, Inker, Fleece, ESP and lexical recall.
Graphshell and Turnstone supply the browsing consumers; Distillery supplies the
model-work consumer. Extend existing modules before proposing further crates.
**Supersedes:** the
[June deferred-phases plan](../../archive_docs/2026-10-11_superseded_plans/2026-06-09_eidetic_deferred_phases_plan.md).
Its OPFS measurements and old index proposals remain historical evidence; their
remaining requirements are carried into P0, P3, P4 and P6 below.

## 1. Direction and ownership

Mark's direction in this conversation is the starting point:

- Fleece lets a person clip, crawl and capture content for a mere. Crawling
  includes local graphs and engine-produced content, directed by goals and
  queries. Ordinary browsing must not impose a crawl on encountered sites.
- Preserve individual visits and their relationships. Equal page addresses or
  equal captured bytes do not make two encounters the same event.
- Import is general intake into retained memory, extending beyond history
  import/export. Preserve original material and conversion evidence.
- Review Chartulary/Stemma, Pandect and Inker alongside Eidetic. ESP and Eidetic
  are reusable foundations that Distillery composes into useful model work,
  much as Turnstone composes graph and document capabilities.
- Make proper use of dependencies: examine their actual capabilities, our use
  of them, feature costs and target support as part of development.
- Selectively replicate collections of notes, clips, renderable documents and
  recognized structured exports from application runtimes into and across meres.
  A receiver should use retained content with the source applications stopped.

The ownership table is the proposed working model for implementation. It does
not authorize changing domain semantics or replacing stored formats silently.

| Owner | Responsibility | Consumer boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Muniment | Byte backends, immutable blobs, mutable slots, journals and atomic storage operations | The host chooses a backend and custody policy |
| Chartulary / Stemma | Resource graph, attributed edits, individual encounters, owner-scoped branches and their projections | External observations are admitted through explicit mappings; arena handles are not portable visit identities |
| Eidetic | Portable intake, typed retained content, schemas, source evidence, browsing corpus, model/corpus/evaluation artifacts | Keeps retained facts interpretable independently of an open browser or loaded model |
| Pandect | Session manifests and lifecycle, graph/reference adapters, settings, restoration and graph-aware retention | Session attachment and saved view state remain distinct from the durable domain's facts |
| Inker | Engine routing and the document/session/capture contracts engines implement | Reports what the selected engine can actually expose |
| Fleece | Extraction, clipping, observed content links and bounded traversal over supplied sources | Source acquisition and session admission remain explicit adapters |
| ESP / eidetic-search | Model execution, embeddings, numerical retrieval, lexical recall and ranking fusion | Results are derived from named source versions and settings |
| Distillery | Model selection, supervised jobs, execution status and reusable work surfaces | Uses ESP for execution and Eidetic for artifacts; the owning application admits proposed edits |

The dataspace draws on durable domain facts, current engine observations,
session context and derived computation. Its visible projection is not an
additional store of truth. Hagiograph remains the domain-defined history and
significance organ; ordinary browsing visits do not acquire significance merely
because they were recorded.

### Portable collections across meres

This is a concrete outcome of the program. A person selects content gathered by
Fleece or exported by a domain runtime; Eidetic retains its named format/version,
bytes, source evidence and required parts; the chosen mere admits a collection
with its meaningful membership and relationships. Another admitted mere can
replicate that selected collection and use supported content independently of
the original application. Local copying and peer delivery use the same content
contract, with their respective destination and disclosure authority.

Use the [shared semantic-core review](../../2026-08-12_family_composition_thesis_brief.md#shared-semantic-core-existing-contracts-and-missing-seams-2026-10-11)
as the starting inventory. Agree on a small versioned profile over existing
bundles, manifests, schemas and graph references. It must name selected roots,
payload roles, required material, selector units, provenance and the retained
relationships. Preview which assets and source evidence will actually travel;
following every graph edge or including an enclosing source document is not an
implicit export rule. Unselected or external references retain their identity
and availability state.

Format recognition, complete local bytes and supported operations are separate
capabilities. The family profile must have a tested receiving path for notes,
document clips and one recognized structured export. Genet or a registered
domain adapter supplies the actual render/inspect behavior. Additional formats
advertise their support and preserve unfamiliar material. An exported snapshot
retains its captured identity and meaning; editing, ongoing collection sync or
operating a live source needs its own declared owner contract.

### Knot/Redshank profile and owner adapters

Mark chose Knot Editor and Redshank as the first heterogeneous pair and handed
the shared profile, owner-adapter and tag design to this Eidetic/Fleece lane.
The four verbatim [clip policy rulings](../../2026-08-12_family_composition_thesis_brief.md#clip-policy-rulings-2026-10-11)
live once in the family brief: private source backing, note/body-first media,
generated tags as queryable suggestions, and reviewed queued edits. They inform
this draft; no schema is frozen and no headed mixed-runtime receipt exists yet.

#### First transfer draft (2026-10-11)

Implemented `eidetic::clip_profile` and Fleece's opt-in `portable-clip` feature.
The draft records distinguish logical/capture/source identity, selected parts,
native anchors, source facts, attributed tags and private backing. Raw body
parts use content-addressed Eidetic objects; built-in schema definitions are
available locally. Imports check the complete required inventory and hashes
before deposits. Existing identical objects keep their original custody and
sealing manifest. Store failure may leave verified immutable objects; application
admission and atomic transactions remain separate gates.

Knot's `knot-composition::selected_export` produces one copied text item, its
native document anchor, pack references and related tag labels. Author notes,
surrounding text and other collection items stay out. Fleece verifies supplied
complete-source backing against the anchor hash and original UTF-8 byte span,
and retains that backing separately. Projection recipes explicitly refuse this
plain-text adapter until a typed recipe exporter is qualified.

Redshank's `export_selected_note` exports one shareable native note with its
frozen recording target and representation receipt. Private notes refuse export.
Fleece requires supplied voice-body bytes and preserves millisecond units,
reaction-adjusted and press offsets, and unknown historical attribution. The
recording remains a reference; full recording backing and encoded excerpts
still need their owner adapter. A voice body is not silently promoted to a
copy of its referenced recording.

Export roots select only named retained parts and their declared dependency
closure. Traversal is bounded and cycle-aware; private backing is outside that
inventory. The package carries selected bytes and content IDs. It omits custody
manifests, seal markers and local custody provenance. Per-application limits
cover parts, bytes and metadata. These helpers use no network provider and
perform no session or graph admission. Foreign typed parts refuse this first
draft, while native selector/evidence vocabulary remains opaque source data.

Native owner-generated fixtures cross the serialized envelope, lose their
source store, and survive receiver-only Fjall close/reopen with exact text and
voice-body bytes. Tests cover missing/altered/extra/duplicate payloads, budget
and disclosure refusal, dependency cycles, stale/split-byte anchors, attribution
round-trip and existing receiver custody. A reversible sealer tests wiring only.
The browser check establishes compilation, not OPFS, rendering or playback.
The dependency check adds no external library: the enabled production edges
are Eidetic, Genet's extractor, Serde and Serde JSON. Eidetic remains built with
its existing default features disabled.

Turnstone's first receiving host now reads selected plain text and plays a
retained WAV body through its existing Inker/Redshank seams. Committed-source
native import, fresh-process restart with the package paths unavailable, and
missing-content refusal pass. Original recording bytes remain unavailable;
source selectors and unknown source-tag attribution stay distinct from playback.
The receiver uses an explicitly unsealed store and makes no encrypted-custody
claim. Its exact source, nine reviewed captures and limits are recorded in
`turnstone/docs/receipts/2026-10-11_retained_clip_receiver/README.md`
(Turnstone `bb09931`, implementation `d2fb07c`). Complete source-backing adapters,
browser receiving, additional assets/structured formats, signed source tags,
generated suggestions and reviewed reconnect queues remain under the host gate
below. This partial native receipt does not close that gate. See the
[Fleece fixture receipt](../../../crates/fleece/tests/fixtures/portable_clip/README.md)
for producer generation and qualification scope.

The draft profile describes meaningful portable material using existing Eidetic
bundles/manifests and graph identity. It does not serialize an application's
whole internal model or make every clip part a separate graph entity.

| Information carried | Required distinction |
|---|---|
| Logical clip or native entity; capture and retained revision | A byte hash identifies a representation, not the owner, clip identity or a live operation target |
| Stable part names and roles; media/schema versions | Selected body, note, visual, source backing, source reference and annotation have explicit roles |
| Selector basis, units and representation version | Knot UTF-8 byte spans, Fleece canonical-text code points and Redshank media time remain distinguishable; supported conversions carry evidence |
| Dependencies per promised capability | Locally retained, explicitly disclosed, required, optional and external material are distinct; dependency traversal is bounded and cycle-aware |
| Source/capture/derivative lineage; owner reference | Native source identity and known source revision survive export; unavailable or unknown facts remain explicit |
| Attributed tags and generated suggestions | Concept owner, tagging asserter and engine evidence remain separate; label-only views are not an interchange record |
| Current availability and supported operations | Read/render/inspect/play/annotate/edit need their own tested capability; a complete note need not include its referenced recording |

Retaining private backing and constructing a disclosed package are separate
operations over that profile. Fleece's full canonical text may exceed the
selection; an export must build an explicit selection envelope instead of
copying the annotation and all its backing by default. Producer adapters retain
the native selector and representation evidence. Generic receivers preserve
unknown parts and visibly report missing capabilities.

The disclosed selected part has its own versioned selector basis. Preserve the
native source anchor as lineage; any supported rebasing records the mapping
between those representations. Reading a selection offline does not establish
that the receiver possesses or can seek within the complete private source.

**Knot adapter.** Use retained composition and captured-artifact ports. Export
the selected body and source anchor; include available complete-source bytes as
private backing under CP1, and disclose only the requested material. Collection
organization is a separately authored revision with compare-and-set behavior.
The original item's signer is not automatically the author of later tags or
organization. Recover signed organization provenance when available; preserve
unknown historical tag authorship otherwise. Owner edits resolve the fresh
target and expected source revision through existing admission; an editable
document token is not the durable entity reference. Record partial retention
and authored-note outcomes separately where the owner does not promise atomicity.

**Redshank adapter.** Export the text/voice-note body and frozen recording target
first. A voice body requires its own audio bytes; the recording stays an explicit
reference or separately chosen backing/excerpt. Preserve representation receipts
and media-time units needed for qualified exact playback. Excerpt encoding and
source-time mapping require a separate explicit exporter. Current annotation
records do not establish historical authorship, user tags or a public source
revision. Add owner-issued revision/admission and durable outcomes at the owner
boundary, without promoting playback tokens or persistence generations to those
roles. Existing guarded seek behavior remains the starting point.

**Tag adapter.** Reuse identity-owned `TagConcept` and attributed resource
statements under the graph-semantics owner. Export the concept and exact tagging
assertion, including source/asserter/scope/time evidence, rather than a label set.
Personal tags apply to the retained clip or note. Source tags stay attributable
to their original target; whether to offer copying them onto a derivative is a
remaining policy choice. Suggested tags keep producer/run, input revision,
settings and review state outside asserted personal `taggedWith`; acceptance
creates a personal assertion citing the suggestion. Whole-resource tagging is
the first supported target; part tagging needs an explicitly qualified selector
profile. Classification records remain their own typed meaning.

**Reviewed reconnect edits.** The session/application owns the durable request
queue. Store supported inert intent, source-owner/entity identity, expected
source revision, payload schema, author and nonreused request identity. Keep
waiting-for-owner, needs-review, stale/denied/unsupported, submitted and durable
completion distinguishable. Reconnect resolves fresh ownership and offers;
review and current grants/revision checks precede submission. A saved scene
instance or session token cannot trigger automatic replay. Local annotations
have their own author and retention and remain available while the owner is away.
Queue budgets and expiry are configurable; missing source grants refuse submit.

Use Turnstone's existing `turnstone/src/knot_authoring.rs` and
`turnstone/src/redshank_host.rs` integrations as the first native receiving-host
candidate, rather than creating another host. Qualify Graphshell as the browser
receiver through its existing intake/session path. These are proposed forcing
hosts: current source integration does not establish collection admission,
portable media rendering or queued-edit support.

## 2. Findings, verified 2026-10-11

Review baseline: Mere `8601f7599e0eb59bd77b10899d49f8fc83792c90` and Turnstone
`1034fb64b133022926bb4c7135b2b3281d09cc3b`. Concurrent Forme implementation and
composition-doc work is present and remains outside this plan's changes.
These are source findings; older execution receipts are not renewed by this review.

1. [Stemma](../../../crates/eidetic/chartulary/src/stemma/mod.rs) already has
   distinct entry, visit and owner records, parent/child branches and projected
   edges. Extend that machinery instead of founding another visit store.
2. [ImportedHistoryVisitItem](../../../crates/eidetic/eidetic-core/src/import/mod.rs)
   carries a visit ID and optional external tab/window context, but lacks a
   referring visit ID. [history_event](../../../crates/eidetic/eidetic-core/src/import/history.rs)
   lowers to URL-based traces and second-derived timestamps without preserving
   the visit ID. The [Firefox exporter](../../../scripts/firefox_history_export.py)
   resolves `from_visit` to a URL and reduces microseconds to seconds.
3. The [extension](../../../ports/graphshell/web/extension/background.js) keeps
   a bounded visit queue and resolves parent IDs to URLs. Its live path chooses
   the latest visit returned for a URL, and can fall back to a history-item ID.
   [BrowserVisit](../../../ports/graphshell/src/capture.rs) has a visit ID but
   lacks profile-instance and parent-visit fields. Admission already stages
   access records, traces and graph updates before acknowledgement.
4. [Pandect](../../../crates/system/pandect/src/lib.rs) already separates
   session, graph, view, reservoir and wallet adapters. [Inker](../../../crates/inker/inker/src/lib.rs)
   reexports the engine-facing `document-session-api` contracts and owns
   `EngineDocument`. [Fleece](../../../crates/fleece/src/traversal.rs) already
   takes source/version references and emits observation receipts and omissions.
5. Generation has an exact [ModelSession](../../../crates/intel/esp/src/infer/session.rs)
   envelope. The [embedding provider](../../../crates/intel/esp/src/embed/provider.rs)
   exposes dimensions and metric; [persisted indexes](../../../crates/intel/esp/src/embed/persistence.rs)
   carry numerical shape without an equivalent model/preprocessing envelope.
   [with_index](../../../crates/intel/esp/src/embed/search.rs) checks dimensions.
6. Eidetic already retains [training corpora and evaluation artifacts](../../../crates/eidetic/eidetic-core/src/models/training.rs);
   [Distillery's trainer](../../../ports/distillery/src/trainer.rs) composes
   those with ESP. General inference hosting remains an open slice in the
   [Distillery models plan](../../mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-10-06_distillery_models_plan.md).
7. [Lexical recall](../../../crates/intel/eidetic-search/Cargo.toml) uses the
   in-tree BM25 implementation and Genet's text segmentation, with no production
   Tantivy dependency. [Muniment](../../../crates/eidetic/muniment/Cargo.toml)
   already offers native backends and a target-gated IndexedDB backend. The June
   proposal for a separate Eidetic OPFS crate is not the current storage floor.

Additional collection review at Mere `d9d9b165f733979a7da563160b215f277181736b`:
[Bundle](../../../crates/eidetic/eidetic-core/src/bundle.rs) already names member
manifests, domain kinds and required flags. Its required-member verifier resolves
those direct members; it does not walk a recursive portable-content dependency
set. [BlobManifest](../../../crates/eidetic/eidetic-core/src/manifest.rs) already
records integrity, schema, source, provenance/privacy and trust metadata.
[Community collections](../../../crates/moot/gemot/src/moot/records/collection.rs)
retain causal membership over signed contribution references. That community
authority is distinct from an arbitrary private collection's selection/admission.
These mechanisms are the starting point, not proof of general cross-mere
content portability.

The handoff's adapter findings were checked at Mere `eac1524f`, Knot Editor
`4d8b81c5ed8fbe29bac9fc762cb71f161e00c784` and Woodshed
`9e4b37238d5febfcfe73b4bc9e291ec93b2ee1cd`:

- `knot-editor/crates/knot-composition/src/lib.rs` has a retained `CollectionItem`
  and `DocumentAnchor` with UTF-8 byte spans and optional complete-text hash.
  `knot-editor/crates/knot-composition/src/retention.rs` separates immutable
  retained material from mutable organization and its CAS revision.
- `knot-editor/crates/knot-editor/src/composition_retention.rs` returns the
  original writer and latest organization revision; the organization writer
  cannot be inferred from that original-author field. Its target/grant checks
  are existing owner machinery, not a general foreign-clip adapter.
- `woodshed/ports/redshank/model/src/lib.rs` has frozen timed targets, text/audio
  bodies and shareable annotation export. An audio body's identifier alone
  transfers no bytes. `woodshed/ports/redshank/desktop/src/diagnostics_worker_tests.rs`
  distinguishes persistence acknowledgement from prior model/UI state; those
  source tests are not re-run by this documentation review.
- [Resource tags](../../../crates/graph/graph-kernel/src/graph/resource_tags.rs)
  already have owner/label concepts and explicit imported asserters.
  [SemanticStatement](../../../crates/graph/graph-kernel/src/graph/edge_data.rs)
  retains statement identity, scope, provenance and time. Label projections
  discard that attribution and cannot substitute for an export envelope.

Browser API facts inform the adapter requirements: Chrome distinguishes
history items from individual `visitId`/`referringVisitId` records; `onVisited`
arrives before page loading completes. The importer must preserve individual
records and observe content separately. [Chrome history API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/history).
A normal page's History API concerns its own session; browser-wide intake needs
an authorized extension or exported data. [MDN History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API).
Tab/document context can be enriched through separately admitted navigation
observations where supported. [Chrome webNavigation API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/webNavigation).
These API facts do not establish a current headed receipt for the proposed changes.

## 3. Dependency use is part of every phase

P0 establishes a small capability ledger. Each later phase updates its rows
with the actual API used, source/version, feature set, target, consumer and
validation. Dispositions are **use as supplied**, **adapt**, **repair our use**,
**upstream fix**, or **replace with evidence**. A dependency being available
does not make every feature useful; a custom implementation needs a measured
semantic or operational reason.

| Dependency family | Review in this program |
|---|---|
| petgraph, slotmap and existing Chartulary/Stemma | Use graph/arena facilities for their intended jobs; distinguish portable identity from local handles, and preserve resource and encounter semantics |
| Muniment over redb, Fjall and IndexedDB; web-sys bindings | Use transactions, scans, durability and platform errors that the backend actually supplies; keep filesystem/browser adapters below Eidetic |
| serde and existing codecs; BLAKE3, UUID and URL canonicalization | Preserve foreign identifiers and byte evidence; use established identity helpers and explicit schema/format versions |
| Eidetic Bundle/manifests/schemas, portable content references and existing collection records | Reuse member and integrity machinery; define a bounded content profile and its dependency traversal rather than replacing those mechanisms |
| Knot composition/capture ports, Redshank timed targets and graph tag statements | Adapt the existing owner contracts; preserve exact units, provenance, grants and durable outcomes rather than inventing parallel tag or owner authorities |
| jsonschema and existing Mere-native validation | Distinguish unavailable validation from invalid material; use the validator's supported behavior rather than duplicating its parser |
| Genet DOM/session/text contracts and Fleece extraction | Consume semantic documents, links, selectors and text segmentation already available; expose genuine capability gaps |
| Burn, CubeCL/wgpu, tokenizers and safetensors through ESP | Use provider/backend facilities, batch work and injected devices; preserve numerical and tokenizer receipts and the shared-device boundary |
| Armillary, mesh, Fetch and Iroh adapters | Reuse execution, cancellation, job and transport contracts; keep admission and resource policy with their existing owners |

Feature review starts with [Eidetic defaults](../../../crates/eidetic/eidetic-core/Cargo.toml)
and [ESP's optional persistence/model-session edge](../../../crates/intel/esp/Cargo.toml):
determine which consumers need signing and full JSON Schema validation. Separate
normal, build and dev dependency cones and test intended feature combinations
without accidental workspace feature unification. Do not claim dependency
counts or browser suitability from manifest inspection alone.

Version upgrades remain owned by the
[dependency currency plan](../../mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-10-08_dependency_currency_plan.md).
This plan supplies use cases and gates for its data/Meaning families, especially
Fjall storage, JSON Schema and tokenizers. It does not start competing lockfile
migrations. New records follow the [format rulings](../../2026-10-06_data_formats_brief.md);
existing signed, hashed and persisted bytes require explicit compatibility work.

## 4. Phases and done-conditions

### P0. Establish owners and dependency capabilities

Inventory the read/write paths of Graphshell capture, Turnstone navigation,
portable import, engine capture and Distillery model work. Classify repeated
types by meaning before consolidating them. Retain foreign transition tags
through deliberate mappings instead of assuming every enum is interchangeable.
Populate the ledger above from locked dependency source and actual consumers.

**Done when:** every planned write and derived projection has a named owner;
the ledger identifies existing APIs, unused useful capabilities, duplicated or
bypassed behavior, feature costs and target limitations. Each proposed shuffle
has a forcing consumer and gate. Missing source or runtime evidence is recorded
as pending rather than inferred. The first slice's wire and migration choices
are concrete and reviewable.
The portable-collection profile names its first producers and receiving hosts,
minimum supported formats and dependency/disclosure rules; schema validation
alone is not counted as a renderer or domain interpreter.

### P1. Preserve encounters through intake

Retain source instance/profile scope, original visit identity, parent reference,
transition, original timestamp precision and available tab/window/document
context. Keep capture-device context distinct from a source visit's known or
unknown original device. Preserve parents outside the selected import range,
and distinguish an unknown parent from an observed root. Handle out-of-order
records, conflicting source facts and branch claims Stemma cannot directly admit.
Raw relationship evidence remains inspectable when a branch cannot be resolved.

Browser adapters must distinguish history-item IDs from visit IDs and prevent
rapid revisits to one URL from collapsing through a latest-only query. Stable
source scope is required across imports; a new import-run ID is not a profile ID.
Map portable identities onto Stemma through a replayable admission mapping.
Review `TraceEvent`, the lineage projection and access records together so
lossless intake does not produce another independent encounter authority.

**Done when:** fixtures preserve repeated visits, two branches from one parent,
two profiles reusing the same visit number, parent arrival after child and a
parent outside the import range. Rapid live revisits survive capture. Re-import
and restart retain the same admitted identities without duplicating events or
moving a live navigation cursor. Existing stored records remain readable or
receive an explicit supported migration; missing facts are not fabricated.

### P2. Admit imported and live history into the chosen mere

Use Eidetic intake to retain source material, digest, scope and conversion
notices, including imports beyond browser history. Pandect and the application
session decide the destination mere and record accepted graph/history changes
through existing attributed funnels. Separate durable facts, session attachment,
navigation cursor and saved projection preferences. Counts and recent-page lists
derive from admitted encounters. Portable trace projections cite their sources.

**Done when:** imported and live encounters join one queryable history in the
selected mere and reopen through Pandect. A second session sees the same durable
facts with its own view/cursor. Retry after failure is idempotent, acknowledgements
follow successful durable admission, and destination switching cannot attach a
late result to another mere. Raw intake and notices remain inspectable under the
user's retention settings. Importing history does not fetch its destinations.

### P3. Capture engine content and relationship evidence

Connect Inker's actual document, clip and capture capabilities to Fleece's
source/version observations. Reuse the existing Fleece annotation and selector
contracts and keep raw material distinct from normalized extraction. Correlate
capture with the originating session and document version, using the
`turnstone/design_docs/2026-08-28_page_capture_plan.md` and page-lifecycle owner
for product attachment and stale-result behavior.

Retain separate evidence for followed navigation, a link contained in a captured
document, clipping provenance and a model-proposed relation. An available link
does not establish that the person noticed it, and an unclicked link is not
automatically a negative preference. An opaque engine must report its limitation.

Carry the completed gathering checkpoint's HTTP follow-through with Fetch:
the bounded client avoids a hidden pooled-request retry, but the existing
streaming checks do not establish a deterministic pooled-cancellation race
receipt. Qualify that race with a controlled negative case when the adapter
can exercise pool cancellation; keep it distinct from general traversal tests.

**Done when:** a loaded document and a non-web/engine-generated source both
yield retained content and inspectable relationships through the same Fleece
seam. Reopening resolves the captured version and selectors; stale completion
is refused. Gathering loaded links produces zero destination fetches. Explicit
crawling respects configurable node, depth, fan-out, request and byte limits,
cancellation, omissions and source receipts.
The HTTP adapter has a separately recorded controlled cancellation-race gate.
The selected runtime exporters also supply the collection profile's required
material and retain exact source/capture identity. A clip's export preview
distinguishes selected content, carried source evidence and external references.
Knot/Redshank producer gates apply CP1/CP2, distinguish unavailable recording
playback from a complete portable note, and keep private backing outside the
selected disclosure envelope.

### P4. Build recall and model work over named evidence

Give persisted embeddings a compatibility envelope naming the model/artifact or
deterministic algorithm, tokenizer/preprocessing, pooling/prefix/normalization,
dimensions, metric and source corpus revisions as applicable. Keep the generic
numerical index usable independently. Review existing lexical recall and ranking
fusion before choosing further indexing dependencies. Derived indexes are
rebuildable projections, and changed source versions invalidate affected results.

Compose one real goal/query consumer with Fleece traversal and ESP assessment.
Distillery's inference surface uses exact model sessions and retains input
references, settings, output references and terminal status in Eidetic. Cancelled
or partial work must remain distinguishable from completed work. Graph changes
remain proposals admitted by the owning application. This is the evidence side
of the Distillery plan's M2/M3, not another execution supervisor.

**Done when:** restart accepts a matching embedding envelope and rejects a
same-dimension index from another space. A real lexical/model provider produces
query results over retained visits and captured content, cites source versions
and explains traversal choices. One reusable Distillery surface streams a real
run, cancels it and reopens its retained record. A meaningful recall/latency
comparison measures the selected dependency use; stub-provider success alone
does not qualify this phase.
Generated tag suggestions are queryable with their run/input evidence. Accepting
one creates a personal assertion; rejecting or regenerating suggestions cannot
rewrite existing personal tags. CP3's evidence and review state survive reopening.
Runtime observations, retained clips/notes and rebuildable indexes keep separate
lifecycles. A suggestion can be queryable at its declared keeping tier without
becoming a personal tag or requiring an explicit clip-promotion operation.

### P5. Qualify adding browsing in a browser

Build on Graphshell's extension queue and browser-hosted mere. Provide selection
of the destination mere, import range, exclusions and a preview of visits and
relationship evidence. Live remembering and explicit content capture have
separate user-configurable controls. Partial import caused by source limits or
queue bounds is visible. Tab-opening context enriches visits only when observed;
historical imports cannot invent it.

**Done when:** headed Chrome and Firefox runs import a branching trail, record
live revisits and optionally keep loaded content. Cold reopen retains visits and
edges; permission refusal and disabled capture are handled, and the chosen
mere's forget operation has tested scope. Browser persistence state, quota
failure and backup/export are visible. Ordinary capture starts no crawl. Each
receipt names its source, target, feature set and supported limits.

#### Browser history into document relations, draft 2026-10-12

Mark agrees to develop existing-browser history capture into relationships for
the document graph. This is a design amendment for P1/P2/P5, with content
observations supplied separately by P3. The encounter contract and adapters
below are proposed work; this amendment changes no runtime or wire schema.

**Source refresh at Mere `28d43dd5`.** The extension's
[live listener](../../../ports/graphshell/web/extension/background.js) selects
only the latest visit for a URL and converts referring visit IDs to URLs. Its
import limits candidates to 512 pages and retains a bounded tail of visits.
[Capture normalization](../../../ports/graphshell/src/capture.rs) also drops
same-URL observations inside a time window even when their visit IDs differ.
Its transition mapping treats `generated` as tab spawning and subframe loads
as redirects, while the
[history projection](../../../crates/eidetic/eidetic-core/src/import/history.rs)
uses a different vocabulary mapping. The
[Firefox exporter](../../../scripts/firefox_history_export.py) drops
`from_visit` identity and microsecond precision. These are repair targets, not
properties of the proposed design.

**Acquire existing records and enrich live records.** Start with the existing
Chromium and Firefox extension adapters. History permission admits a selected
import range or live remembering; additional navigation observation has its
own control. Both browsers distinguish page-level history items from individual
visits carrying a referring visit ID:
[Chrome history](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/history),
[Firefox VisitItem](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/history/VisitItem).
Read visits for each candidate address and retain source relationships before
projecting them. History import issues zero page requests.

For live intake, serialize reconciliation per address and collect all unseen
visit IDs, with an overlapping reconciliation range after suspension. A
latest-only result or timestamp watermark cannot prove delivery of every visit.
Retry identifiers deduplicate delivery; distinct visit IDs survive proximity
in time. When an adapter has no stable visit ID, retain that limitation rather
than treating a URL/time guess as proven identity.

Import completeness is a separate result. History search returns page items,
not a paginated visit stream; in particular Firefox documents filtering by
`lastVisitTime`:
[history.search](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/history/search).
A page revisited after an import's end may still have visits inside the selected
range. Discover candidates without excluding such pages, then filter individual
visit timestamps. A candidate cap, saturated time partition, queue overflow or
source retention limit must report partial or unknown coverage. A successful
batch acknowledgement does not imply a complete range. An explicit database
export can provide another adapter, beginning with the existing Firefox script;
it must retain original IDs, parent references and timestamp precision, report
its database/schema assumptions and use an authorized consistent snapshot.

**Proposed encounter contract.** Extend existing Eidetic intake/history types
instead of creating a second browser history store. Retain:

- Stable source scope: browser product, registered profile instance and history
  generation. Import runs are delivery identity, not profile identity. File and
  extension adapters need an explicit binding when they describe the same source.
- Original visit ID and original parent visit reference, including unresolved
  parents. Missing, source-reported root, outside-range and policy-withheld
  parents have distinct states; a parent URL alone cannot identify an encounter.
- Resource locator, source timestamp with original precision, raw transition
  type/qualifiers and adapter version. Normalized transition is a projection.
- Available tab/window/frame/document observations, scoped to their source
  lifecycle. Historical titles may describe the latest page item, rather than
  the page as seen during an old visit; preserve that qualification.
- Acquisition time/device and known source locality separately. Chrome's
  `isLocal` can distinguish local from synced visits; it does not identify the
  original remote device or the persona who made that visit.
- Source material/digest and conversion notices through existing
  [Intake](../../../crates/eidetic/eidetic-core/src/import/intake.rs).
  Conflicting facts for the same source identity remain inspectable and do not
  silently replace an admitted encounter.

**Relations retain their evidence.** The following names describe meanings,
not newly selected enum variants or predicate IRIs:

| Evidence | Encounter relationship | Document-graph projection |
|---|---|---|
| Source `referringVisitId` | Browser-reported predecessor/reference | Directed address relation citing both encounters; an observed link transition may refine it to followed navigation |
| Observed new-tab navigation target | Opened from a source tab/document | Branch relation only when the originating encounter can be resolved |
| Observed redirect transition/qualifiers | Redirect step or qualified redirect observation | Redirect relation; retain intermediate-address gaps rather than inventing a complete chain |
| Reload or distinct repeat visit | Another encounter with the same resource | Additional visit/count and inspectable occurrence, including same-resource transitions |
| Captured document contains a link | Link at a retained document version/anchor | Contains-link relation; it does not establish a visit or a click |
| Explicit clip from a captured version | Clip derived from source and selection | Provenance relation citing the retained version, selector and originating encounter when known |
| Temporal proximity or model output | Candidate association | Separately labelled derived suggestion; it does not establish navigation parentage |

Live tab/document enrichment uses separately admitted observations such as
[Chrome webNavigation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/webNavigation)
and [Firefox navigation targets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webNavigation/onCreatedNavigationTarget).
A new-tab event identifies source and target tabs, not automatically a history
visit ID. Preserve the observation when correlation is ambiguous. A subframe
parent document is containment context, not a referring visit. Same-document
navigation can change an address without proving a new content version.

**Admission and projection.** Eidetic retains source evidence; Pandect and the
receiving host freeze the selected mere and attribution for the batch. Admit
resolved visits through Chartulary/Stemma with a stable foreign-to-local identity
mapping, then derive access records, recall traces and document relations from
those admitted encounters. Every derived edge must expose its supporting source
handles; aggregation over a pair of documents must retain the individual visits.
URL identity does not prove captured-byte identity. Unvisited link targets may
appear as clearly unvisited references without triggering acquisition.

Stemma's current
[visit_entry](../../../crates/eidetic/chartulary/src/stemma/mutations.rs)
uses the owner's current visit as parent and moves that cursor. Import needs a
reviewed explicit-parent admission seam, not replay of a chronological list
through the live cursor. Keep unresolved/conflicting/non-tree relationship
evidence in intake; do not rewrite historical parentage or a live cursor merely
to make a branch fit. The existing
[lineage projection](../../../crates/eidetic/eidetic-core/src/browsing/lineage.rs)
is a starting point, but its URL-based TraceEvent projection must gain source
references before it can support lossless encounter inspection.

**Controls and custody.** Preview visits, supported relations, omitted facts,
destination, range and exclusions before import. Live remembering, content
capture and goal-directed crawl remain separate controls. Apply exclusions to
relationship endpoints as well as destinations; withholding a parent must not
leak its address through an edge, source envelope or notice. Acknowledge only
durable admission, and refuse a late result for a changed destination. Queue
limits and data loss are visible. Forget scope and re-import behavior are an
explicit user choice; browser deletion does not silently dictate mere deletion.

Private deployment requires custody of the entire path: extension staging,
source evidence, encounter records, graph snapshots and indexes. The current
queue uses ordinary extension storage, and capture calls the unsealed access
writer even though a
[sealed writer](../../../ports/graphshell/src/access.rs) exists. Sealing only
that payload would not qualify the other copies. A locked/unavailable destination
must visibly pause capture or use an explicitly supported bounded sealed inbox.
Keep this gate separate from synthetic unsealed graph fixtures.

**First implementation slice and done-conditions.** Repair the encounter
contract and existing extension/import adapters, then qualify admission and
graph projection with a synthetic branching history: A leads to B and C, B is
revisited twice rapidly, and one child arrives before its parent. Re-import and
cold reopen preserve the encounters and derived edges; another profile reusing
the same visit IDs stays distinct. Include an outside-range parent, excluded
parent, ambiguous tab correlation, same-resource transition, subframe/generated
transitions, failed-write retry, full queue, tied search results and a page whose
latest visit lies after the selected range. Prove zero destination fetches and
no live-cursor movement. Expose a relation's exact supporting encounters in the
graph. Renew Chromium and Firefox headed receipts separately when their runs
are authorized; other browsers require their own adapter/evidence review.
Content clipping, broader formats and sealed custody then exercise this same
admission boundary, with their own consumer gates.

### P6. Qualify storage, custody, retention and exchange

Make selective replication of a portable collection a forcing consumer here,
following P2/P3 rather than waiting for model work. Assemble the selected roots,
membership and meaningful edges plus the profile's required bytes, schemas and
assets through a bounded, cycle-aware traversal. Reuse bundle resolution and
hash verification, with explicit limits and missing/denied/unsupported outcomes.
Required bytes must actually be available at the receiver before it reports a
complete offline copy. Optional material and external references remain visible.
Destinations admit the collection through their existing attributed write and
retention paths; retry cannot duplicate admitted content or erase its lineage.

For shared community collections, reuse Gemot's contribution/collection authority
and Stickleback's accepted-operation replication under the
[community collection plan](../../moothold_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-06-12_moot_object_m1_plan.md#community-collections-and-author-offline-publishing-2026-09-04).
Private cross-mere copying does not require community publication. Collection
membership replication and delivery of the corresponding byte payloads each
need qualification. Later subscriptions must define membership/revision updates,
local edits and withdrawal rather than inheriting snapshot-copy semantics.

Reuse Muniment's existing backend contract and the host's custody/sealing owners.
Compare native and browser workloads under equivalent durability requirements;
the June OPFS-versus-Fjall numbers used different flush behavior and cannot
select a new backend by themselves. An additional OPFS adapter or packed layout
requires a demonstrated unmet workload and belongs below Eidetic. Requesting
persistent browser storage can be refused. [MDN StorageManager.persist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/StorageManager/persist).
Retain the [archived-plan tails](../../mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-07-03_archived_plan_tails_plan.md)
checkpoint on whether an additional adapter must implement `Backend::transact`
before consumer adoption; browser storage availability alone does not settle it.

Define how encounters, captures, schemas, model/corpus references, tombstones and
derived indexes participate in retention. Preserve named checkpoints for deletion
and shared-reference semantics before implementation. Reuse current signature,
schema and transport admission for exchange; disclose unfamiliar payloads without
claiming to interpret them. Community recall starts from admitted source records
and local reminting. The former `EngramDirectory` proposal needs a concrete
large-corpus consumer and a fresh comparison before returning as a dependency.

**Done when:** real backend close/reopen and failure fixtures preserve atomic
admission; quota and persistence refusal have supported outcomes; collection
cannot remove material still required by an admitted retained reference under
the selected policy. A supported export/import round trip retains encounter
identity and evidence. For any peer consumer, existing admission rejects altered
or unadmitted input and preserves supported foreign fields. Backend/format
migrations include recovery and measured gates, owned jointly with their
existing migration plans. Remote erasure is not inferred from local forgetting.

**Portable-collection gate:** a selected collection containing a note, a document
clip with a required image, and one recognized structured export moves between
native and browser-hosted meres. Stop the source apps and origin services, then
restart the receiver: it still renders/inspects supported content, resolves its
parts and selectors, and shows preserved provenance and relationships. Omit an
unselected item, retain an explicitly external relation, exercise a missing
required asset and unsupported schema, and verify a retry and local derivative
keep their declared identities. A two-device receipt separately qualifies peer
delivery. Source review, generic cards or successful blob transfer alone do not
pass this gate.

**Knot/Redshank host gate:** a real shared host receives a Knot selection and
a Redshank text/voice note, then reopens with both source apps stopped. Private
source backing is retained where available and absent from selection-only
sharing. Voice-body bytes are present; missing recording bytes give an honest
playback-unavailable state. Exercise explicit excerpt export separately. Verify
selector units, unknown schema retention, two tag concepts with equal labels but
different owners, exact asserter provenance, and acceptance of an engine tag
suggestion. Queue one supported edit while its owner is absent; reconnect shows
review, re-resolves the source and refuses stale/denied requests. A current
reviewed edit has an owner-issued durable outcome, with retry/deduplication
qualified separately from message acceptance. The structured-export gate above
remains a later heterogeneous extension rather than an entry prerequisite.

## 5. Order and decisions still to make

Start **P0 -> P1 -> P2** with the bounded visit-preservation slice. P3 can follow
the identity/admission contract; P4 consumes P1/P2 evidence and P3 captures.
P5 first qualifies metadata intake after P2, then content capture after P3.
Storage/custody review in P6 accompanies all durable changes; new backends and
federated consumers wait for their demonstrated need. Qualify a native consumer
and browser consumer separately, and record compile, automated, headed and
physical evidence separately.
The portable-collection profile starts in P0; producer support follows P3 and
P6's selected-copy gate follows P2/P3. This core portability result does not
depend on the later inference or community-search slices.

The implementation proposals still need these concrete decisions:

1. Portable encounter envelope and its mapping to native Stemma identity;
   supported old records and handling of malformed or contradictory parent facts.
2. Session/domain scope of imported and live encounters, destination selection,
   and configurable retention defaults. Engine website storage remains under
   the [native session-store plan](../../mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-06-23_native_session_store_plan.md).
3. The first engine pair, embedding-envelope consumer and Distillery inference
   host, including device injection and browser executor support.
4. Deletion/reference semantics, any demonstrated backend gap, accepted-schema
   discovery and the first exchange consumer. These are named checkpoints;
   the plan does not choose a universal database or automatic sharing policy.
5. The first portable-content profile, supported receiver formats/operations,
   required dependency rules and preservation of collection relationships. A
   selected snapshot and an ongoing synchronized collection have separate gates.
   Knot/Redshank now supply the first pair; exact wire fields and capability
   promises remain draft choices. CP1 to CP4 have settled their named policies.
6. Source-tag copying onto derivatives, rights/revocation and deletion/reference
   consequences, and measured backing/queue budgets. The safe draft preserves
   source tags as related facts and creates new clip assertions only through
   an attributable action; that copying policy remains a named checkpoint.

## 6. Progress

- **2026-10-11.** Expanded the Eidetic development direction with Mark's visit,
  related-crate and dependency-use requirements. Reviewed current intake,
  branching, capture, session, model and storage seams. Archived the June
  deferred plan and carried its relevant tails forward. No runtime code changed;
  implementation and source-qualified consumer receipts remain pending.
- **2026-10-11, collection clarification.** Mark named selective replication
  of portable app content as a required result. Added the shared profile,
  existing bundle/manifest/collection inventory and native/browser offline-copy
  gate. Content portability is core work alongside P2/P3, with peer delivery and
  ongoing synchronization qualified separately. No implementation started.
- **2026-10-11, Knot/Redshank handoff.** Verified Mark's forcing-pair request,
  four policy answers and authorization to coordinate in the dynamics chat.
  Accepted shared profile, owner-adapter and tag design here. Recorded CP1 to CP4
  once in the family brief, drafted the adapter/profile requirements and added
  offline disclosure, tag attribution and reviewed reconnect gates. Existing
  dynamics pauses and unrelated editor work remain unchanged. No schema was
  frozen and no runtime implementation or new execution receipt was produced.
- **2026-10-11, first transfer draft.** Implemented the records, bounded selected
  envelope, Knot/Redshank producer exports and Fleece intake helpers above.
  Native Fleece tests pass (7 traversal, 6 transfer/schema cases); the enabled
  library compiles for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. Shared-checkout owner regression
  checks pass: Knot composition 48 tests with one optional OEWN fixture ignored;
  Redshank model 33 tests. These are automated source/byte/store receipts, not
  headed host, peer-sync or physical audio acceptance. Exact committed producer
  bases pass their focused export tests and reproduce the transfer fixture
  hashes: Knot `21e1b0f6f739ef023fc71152fb1f8ce80354a3e2`; Woodshed
  `a7dcb54066d37ec53b182d7ffe75dd6952fb09df`, published through the source-identical
  documentation merge `961731ace9ae9e687bdf8d40a032f2e1fbbf3321`. Only owned
  export paths were integrated; temporary collision worktrees were removed.
- **2026-10-11, native receiver slice.** Turnstone `d2fb07c` admits selected
  packages to the receiving mere's Muniment/Fjall store, resolves retained
  addresses locally with NoFetcher, lowers a real Inker view and plays held WAV
  bodies on its existing Redshank output runtime. Receipt publication `bb09931`
  qualifies import, package-unavailable fresh-process reopening and missing
  local identity refusal in Windows, with nine reviewed native captures. The
  reopened Play link reaches Ended 500 ms through ordinary pointer routing.
  All accepted runs have zero acquisition attempts and eager peer services;
  62 sampled TCP/UDP endpoint observations are empty. The broad library gate
  passes 789 tests with ten existing ignores; six final receiver tests and one
  offline-port test cover the later focus repair and host-only read/control
  hardening. One immutable Mere source supplies 75 resolved packages after
  coherent producer/renderer/identity adoption. This is a synthetic text/WAV
  native receiver receipt, with unsealed retained storage; acoustic quality,
  browser/structured receiving, recording excerpts, tag acceptance, reviewed
  reconnect edits and P6 custody/retention remain open.
- **2026-10-12, selected onward copy.** Turnstone implementation `97c1394` and
  qualification `9412077` expose the existing Fleece selected-body exporter
  through a host-only clip link and contextual command. A first receiver with
  original package paths unavailable exports only chosen Knot/WAV clips; a
  second independent native mere receives their unchanged envelopes, retains
  the same content references and source facts, and reopens/plays after both
  sending app and all package paths disappear. The unselected note stays
  unavailable. Nine onward captures qualify the default Windows host; 794
  library tests pass with ten existing ignores, and ten final focused tests
  include changed/missing held-body refusal, budgets, excluded backing and
  unselected data, distinct tag-owner metadata, frozen Workbench selection and
  replacement policy. No schema, collection format, dependency or supplier pin
  changed. This uses the existing bounded dependency closure and NoFetcher.
  The store stays unsealed. Browser/structured receiving, recording excerpts,
  signed/accepted tags, reviewed owner edits, peer delivery and P6 remain open.
- **2026-10-12, browser-history relation design.** Refreshed the existing
  extension, imported-history, access, Stemma and lineage source seams at
  `28d43dd5`, and checked official Chromium/Firefox history and navigation APIs.
  P5 now specifies source-scoped encounter identity, retained parent references,
  raw transition evidence, visible import coverage and evidence-backed document
  relations, plus an explicit-parent admission seam that preserves live cursors.
  The forcing fixture includes rapid revisits, branches, out-of-order parents,
  redacted/outside-range endpoints, source-ID collisions and partial imports.
  This is a documentation-only design amendment; runtime, schema, custody and
  renewed headed browser qualification remain open.
